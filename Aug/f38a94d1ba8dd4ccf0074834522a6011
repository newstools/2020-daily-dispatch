Shortage of staff personnel at all Buffalo City Metro (BCM) facilities will be a thing of the past as the entire municipal workers have been called back to work after the country moved to lockdown level 2. Since the national lockdown began in March, some BCM employees have been working in shifts in a bid to avert the coronavirus spread, leaving many residents in the lurch as they could not get their municipal services on time. In a virtual adress on Thursday evening, BCM mayor Xola Pakti said,:In terms of our provision of service, we want to inform the public that we have instructed all staff members to report for duty as the municipality is expected to perform all its functions and services.” He said the metro had recorded 466 deaths to Covid-19 so far. “We are happy that with the reduction of cases in our city with active cases standing at 550, we are now seeing that the death rate has drastically declined, and this is confirmed by the number of burials that are taking place each week,” Pakati said. “We have moved from experiencing around 60 burials a week to around 30 and this fact is also confirmed by most funeral parlours in the city.” He urged residents to adhere to lockdown level 2 regulations. “Our request for more vigilance is due to the fact if not careful we might experience a second wave of rising infections leading to the virus to cause more deaths and orphan many children.” DispatchLIVE
