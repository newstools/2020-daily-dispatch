The Mthatha Magistrates Court on Wednesday issued a warrant of arrest against AbaThembu Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo. NPA spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said that thus was after Prince Dalindyebo and his legal representative failed to appear in court without an explanation. "On June 08, the former acting King of AbaThembu appeared briefly at the same court on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and pointing of a firearm. He was released on warning and his matter was postponed to today ( Wednesday)," said Tyali. He said that the court postponed the case indefinitely pending his arrest. The case is in connection in the case of alleged assault of Babalo Papu, spokesperson and advisor to Azenathi's father, King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. DispatchLIVE
