Deputy public protector advocate Kholeka Gcaleka is in the Eastern Cape to assess conditions of hospitals. Gcaleka's two-day visit started in the Nelson Mandela Bay on Monday and she wrapped it up in the OR Tambo district on Tuesday. Unfilled critical vacancies, shortage of equipment such as linen, admission space and decaying infrastructure were some of the major challenges that caught her attention. Speaking at Mthatha General Hospital, Gcaleka said that it was quite clear that it was an old and neglected hospital. “Having met both the management and unions, we have been told and observed shortage of bed linen, high vacancy rate is high, and decaying infrastructure. There are systematic  infrastructure challenges ... structural challenges ... but they are historical, not new. The coronavirus has increased the burden on the hospitals and make difficult to execute their duties,” said Gcaleka, who also had a meeting with stakeholders. Gcaleka said there were “glaring” infrastructure and resources  problems. “What I need to mention is that we have taken a stance to work together with the government and try to resolve the challenges that the people of South Africa are facing.”
