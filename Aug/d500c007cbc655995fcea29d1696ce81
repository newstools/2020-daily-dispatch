The Democratic Alliance in the Eastern Cape opened a case of perjury against the provincial education department's administration boss Themba Kojana in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. The DA claimed  that Kojana had lied, while under oath, to the provincial legislature about the actual value of their multi-million rand e-learning contract. The case was opened at the Humewood police station in Port Elizabeth on Thursday morning by DA MPL Yusuf Cassim. He accused Kojana of breaching the Evidence and Information Before the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature Act 4 of 2007. Cassim claimed that in a meeting in May Kojana provided the legislature with an amount they had paid for the contract, and that such figure later changed and increased drastically when Kojana again presented to the same legislature committee in July. He said his actions were tantamount to "lying to the legislature while under oath". The department on Thursday fired back at the DA,  saying Cassim's move was "grandstanding" and that they cannot wait to face such allegations in court, so that they could lay the matter to rest for good. This is a developing story. - DispatchLIVE
