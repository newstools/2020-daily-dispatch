The recent bush fires around Buffalo City Metro did not only expose how the city is being run but also how the fire department is under-equipped. The fires, especially those which ravaged the houses in Adderley Crescent, Buffalo Flats,  left most of us in shock. The fire hydrants could not be located in the street as they have been covered by the overgrowing grass. The valve at the corner of Adderley Crescent was not working, though  it was reported to BCM numerous times over the past three years. My question is when will the valve be serviced, marked, and made visible for future disasters? â€” Burton Brown, via e-mail
