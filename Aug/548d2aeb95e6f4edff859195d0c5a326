Police recovered 16 stolen water tanks in the Eastern Cape over the weekend. The tanks were stolen when a man driving from KwaZulu-Natal to Mthatha was hijacked early last week. Police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni on Sunday said the water tanks and two trailers were found abandoned in a warehouse in Dutywa on Saturday. “The Toyota Hilux was found abandoned in Mthatha. The total value of the recovered goods is R500,000,” said Tonjeni. “It is alleged that on August 11 a white Toyota Hilux VVTI, delivering the tanks from Port Shepstone to the Mthatha area, was stopped by a white Ford Ranger with four  occupants. They allegedly pointed the driver with a firearm and demanded keys for the bakkie before proceeding to Dutywa where they offloaded 16 tanks in a warehouse.” The 24-year-old driver escaped unscathed and went straight to Dutywa police station to report the matter. The tanks were handed back to the rightful owner. No arrests have been made yet. Provincial commissioner Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga commended the police for their efforts.
