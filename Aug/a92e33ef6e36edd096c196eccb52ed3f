Shock, surprise and denial. This was the reaction of serial rape and murder accused Malibongwe Ncokolo in the Bhisho high court on Wednesday. Ncokolo said he had not even heard about the rapes that happened in Mdantsane between 2014 and 2017. State prosecutor  Deolin Willemse told Ncokolo that witnesses  who testified in court said the 46-year-old had strangled them. "(To make sure) that they could not scream for help,” Willemse said. “I don't know that,” Ncokolo replied. He said he had been “surprised” when the state put it to him that he had raped 21 women since September 2014. Ncokolo said he was shocked that a girl he knew from his area of NU2 was among the two dead bodies discovered in a bush not far from his home. He faces 21 counts of rape, two counts of robbery, three counts of murder, four counts of common assault, nine counts of assault with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm and one count of sexual assault. The case has been postponed to November 2 for written argument submission.
