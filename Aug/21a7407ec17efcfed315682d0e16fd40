ANC MP Hishaam Mohamed has died, the party confirmed on Monday. ANC caucus spokesperson Nomfanelo Kota told TimesLIVE: “Yes, I can confirm that indeed he has passed on. We will be issuing out a statement shortly.” TimesLIVE understands Mohamed suffered a sudden heart attack. In a short statement on Monday evening, Mohamed's friend Kashief Wicomb said: "It is with deep sadness that we confirm the death of comrade Hishaam Mohamed at 5.30pm today. He was a dedicated and unselfish cadre of our movement and servant of the people. From God we come and to God we return." Mohamed is a former head of the department of justice and constitutional development in the Western Cape. He was elected to parliament in May 2019 and served in the portfolio committee on justice and constitutional development and correctional services. Before joining parliament he had worked at the department of justice for 27 years. He started as a temporary clerk at the Athlone magistrate’s court in 1990, obtained his LLB degree and worked his way up to become a prosecutor at the Mitchells Plain magistrate’s court.
