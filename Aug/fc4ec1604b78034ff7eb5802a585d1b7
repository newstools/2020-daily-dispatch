Two Eastern Cape beauties have impressed the nation and made it into the top 10 of this year’s  Miss SA competition. Aphelele Mbiyo, 24 and Melissa Nayimulu, 24, are a step closer in competing for the coveted crown. The Official Miss SA social media accounts announced the top 10 selection on Wednesday morning. Mbiyo was born in Mthatha and raised in Port Elizabeth. She holds a BA in integrated marketing communications. Nayimuli  was born and bred in Butterworth and  now lives in Sunninghill, Johannesburg where she works as an account manager for a marketing agency. She has a BA in Motion Picture Medium from AFDA and majored in television writing. Last month, the pageant announced its top 15 contestants after thousands of women across the country submitted video entries on social media. The country took to the voting polls to select their top 10. On Wednesday Miss SA organisers said the top 10 were from six of the country’s provinces including; Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Limpopo and North West. Commenting on the selection of the finalists, Stephanie Weil, chief executive of the Miss SA pageant, said: “We have whittled down these finalists from literally thousands of entrants, and we believe we have found the 10 women who, right now, represent everything Miss SA stands for." “Any one of these women could be crowned the winner, but only one will take the crown from her predecessor, Sasha Lee Olivier. "We can look forward to a very exciting pageant where our judges are going to have the extremely difficult task of choosing Miss SA 2020.” The 62nd edition of the pageant will take place on October 24.  This year’s show will be screened live on M-Net and Mzansi Magic.  - Additional reporting by Khanyisile Ngcobo (Sunday Times Lifestyle).
