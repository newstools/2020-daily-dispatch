The South African police in Aberdeen are investigating a case of a missing person. Six-year old Tri-Anette Mintoor, nicknamed Kleintjie, was last seen on Wednesday  29 July when she was walking along a gravel road between Murraysburg and Aberdeen. According to captain Bradley Rawlinson, spokesperson for the Graaff-Reinet SAPD cluster, Kleintjie was wearing a brown long-sleeved top, blue jeans and black and white tekkies at the time of her disappearance. Members of the Graaff-Reinet Rural Safety unit (GRS), an inclusive community initiative that has established a successful cooperating relationship with the SAPD, will join the Aberdeen police  on Saturday to expand the search for the missing child. “We will tackle this today and leave no stone unturned until we have found Kleintjie,” said Johann Harmse, representative of the GRS. The search will include the use of several drones to comb a larger area in an attempt to locate the child. Members of the public who may have seen Kleintjie or have any information about her whereabouts, are urged to contact the Aberdeen police station on  049-846 0015. - DispatchLIVE
