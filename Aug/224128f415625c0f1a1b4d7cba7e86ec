The Mthatha magistrate’s court issued  a warrant of arrest on Wednesday against AbaThembu Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo. NPA spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said this was after Azenathi and his legal representative failed to appear in court without  explanation. “On June 8, the former acting King of AbaThembu [Azenathi] appeared briefly at the same court on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm [assault GBH] and pointing of a firearm,”  Tyali said. “He was released on warning and his matter was postponed to today [Wednesday].” He said  the court has postponed the case indefinitely pending his arrest. The case is in connection with the assault of Babalo Papu, the spokesperson  and advisor to Azenathi’s father, King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Azenathi’s lawyer, Sinawo Makhangela, told the Dispatch: “We have a medical certificate to prove that our client was not well and booked off sick. “So the warrant will be stayed — meaning it will not be effective — for  the next 14 days when he will have to be in court to explain why he did not attend.” Azenathi’s charges include  pointing a firearm. His  arrest in June followed allegations by  Papu that Azenathi and several others assaulted him. Pictures of Papu, beaten and naked, were circulated on social media soon  after the alleged attack. Azenathi’s spokesperson, Nkosi Dumisani Mgudlwa, said  Azenathi was a law-abiding citizen and would not fail to  attend court  without a legitimate  reason. “There is a clear and legal reason for why he did not attend the case today,”  Mgudlwa said.
