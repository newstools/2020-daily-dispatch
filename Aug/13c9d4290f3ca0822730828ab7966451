Burying their daughter, the distraught family of slain Wits student Asithandile Zozo, affectionately known as Kwasa, called for government to  strengthen laws against gender-based violence and homicide in South Africa. Zozo, who was killed on Monday, was buried on Saturday at her ancestral home of Bholotwa village in Dutywa, where hundreds of mourners came to pay their last respects after Zozo  was stabbed to death, allegedly by her  former boyfriend. Zozo's devastated parents, Ntombekhaya Lugalo-Zozo and Mzulungile Zozo, said enacting stringent GBV laws, improving the education system and making higher education accessible to masses and the poor would be especially meaningful to them as a family as  their 19-year-old daughter  had been active in these areas. “In Kwasa's memory and for all other women who brutally died in the hands of these monsters, we call upon the government to strengthen laws against women abuse, killing and raping of women and children. Also, the government should make higher education easily accessible to the poor people of remote rural areas,” said Zozo's mother. Speakers at the funeral, including Mbhashe mayor Samkelo Janda and family spokesperson Dumisani Zozo, an OR Tambo municipality councillor, lashed out at men who  abuse women. Zozo's ex-boyfriend, Viwe Rulumeni, 22, who is accused of her murder, briefly appeared in court on Thursday. The case was postponed for Wednesday for consideration of bail and further investigation.​ DispatchLIVE
