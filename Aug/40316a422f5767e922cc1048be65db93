Social media users have welcomed the suspension of Kaizer Chiefs football manager, Bobby Motaung, for allegedly partying despite gatherings being prohibited during lockdown. Videos of the alleged incident continue to be widely shared on social media with critics saying he risked the safety of players and staff as the PSL season is expected to resume this month. In its statement, the club said an internal investigation into Motaung's conduct led to the decision to “summarily suspend” him until August 31. “With the Covid-19 pandemic, our processes have been intensified and stringent measures have been put in place to ensure the club and its members play a role in the curbing of the spread of the virus and flattening the curve.” The club said Motaung tested negative for Covid-19 on four occasions, but is required to self-quarantine.
