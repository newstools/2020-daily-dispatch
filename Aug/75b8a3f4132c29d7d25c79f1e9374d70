A 29-year-old man was allegedly bludgeoned to death by pupils at Smuts Ndamase High School at Nkanga village in Libode on Sunday night. The body of Bulelani Nocuza was found on Monday morning. The family of Nocuza confirmed to DispatchLIVE on Monday afternoon that he had died at the school premises. “I am just coming from the school and the forensic unit has just removed the body,” said Bronze Nocuze, the uncle of the deceased. “This is so traumatic for the family. He was not armed when he was killed ... he was only carrying his cellphone. He was not a threat to anyone.” It was unclear what led to the murder. Education department spokesperson Loyiso Pulumani  said the department was shocked by the incident. “That is a shocking  turn of events. Clearly  this does not  help the already existing  instability  at the school. The district  office  has assigned a  circuit  manager  to deal with this  matter  in order  to restore stability at that school,” said Pulumani. Eastern Cape police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci confirmed police were investigating the matter. “A case of murder has been registered and no arrest made at this stage,” Soci said. DispatchLIVE
