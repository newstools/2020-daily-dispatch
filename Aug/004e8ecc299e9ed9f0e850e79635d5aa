One of five people accused of killing former Bhisho legislature official Nosipho 'Ma-J' Sidabuka-Jombile will plead guilty to the crime, the Qumbu magistrate's court heard on Wednesday. Paul Edkins, 38,  told the court he was not under duress to plead guilty but was doing so "of his own free will" and so he could clear his conscience. The remaining four accused are Komanisi-Jombile, 39, her policeman husband and Sidabuka-Jombile's ex-husband Phindile Jombile, 52, her sister Sibongile Komanisi, 41 and Danisile Bhotyumpha, 55. Sidabuka-Jombile, 51, who was affectionately known as Ma-J, and her son, Abongile Jombile, 22, were travelling from Mabaleni  to Qumbu  on June 11 when their vehicle was stopped by a silver Polo with two occupants. The two men allegedly pretended to be inquiring about something before pointing  a firearm at her and demanding money. Her son was pistol-whipped on the head and upper body but managed to flee, according to the police. One man fired a shot at  Sidabuka-Jombile’s chest and grabbed her handbag before dragging the injured woman to their getaway vehicle and  speeding off.
