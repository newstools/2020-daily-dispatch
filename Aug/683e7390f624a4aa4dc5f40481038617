East London bikers joined the nationwide protest against farm attacks on Saturday. A mass bike ride from Gonubie through town to Nahoon highlighted the plight of South African farmers. The Scatterlings Adventure Bike Group road captain John Rademan said 30 of his members came out to support the cause. "This is about rural safety and this is personal for me. Shaun Krull was killed in a farm attack and this why I came out," Rademann said. On Wednesday, DispatchLIVE reported that farm attacks have tripled in four years in the Eastern Cape, and as Covid-19 took hold this year, stock thieves plundered livestock worth almost R18m in three months. DA MPL Bobby Stevenson, who is the party’s shadow safety and security MEC, tore into the farm and rural crime statistics released by safety & security MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe in response to the questions. Stevenson said they now knew that: * There were 74 farm attacks in the province in the 2019/20 financial year; * Farm attacks rose from 26 in 2016/17 to 34 in 2017/18 and 48 in 2018/19; and * Addo is a farm attack hotspot with 14 of the 74 attacks occurring there. Stevenson said: “The official crime statistics released last month showed the Eastern Cape, along with the Free State, had the highest number of farm murders in the country, with 12 people murdered on farms in each province.” DispatchLIVE
