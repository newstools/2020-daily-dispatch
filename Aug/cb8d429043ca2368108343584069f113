Mnquma municipality council support manager Mninawe Caswell Makabeni has died of Covid-19 related complications. Makabeni, 57,  described by  Mnquma municipal manager  Silumko Mahlasela as an “incorruptible and non-factional” servant of council, is the second senior Mnquma official to succumb to the virus. Building manager Mandlonke Livingstone Ntunja  died recently after more than 30 years of service. Makabeni joined the municipality in 2000 and served as committee secretary, senior committee secretary and council support manager. Mahlasela said the municipality had not been immune to the ravages of the pandemic. Some 10 officials have tested positive for Covid-19 and  are recovering at home or  in self-isolation. “Death has once again robbed us by taking one of our own colleagues, Mr Kabzit, as we fondly called him. He was very committed to his work and had managed to work through tumultuous times of instability and factionalism in council, but throughout he managed to keep his integrity intact by doing his job without fear or favour,” Mahlasela said. “He rose above it all. He could not be easily influenced to a particular agenda of factional tendencies within council.” Mahlasela said the best way to honour Makabeni's memory was for the municipality to remain resolute in its efforts to transform local government. He sent condolences to Makabeni's family, friends and loved ones.  “We thank the family in particular for lending us a man of his calibre,” he said. The municipality has organised a drive-through memorial at Makabeni's home on Friday. He will be laid to rest in Tsomo on August 11.
