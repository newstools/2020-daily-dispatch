Minister of justice and correctional services Ronald Lamola has published a draft law regulating legal dagga possession in SA, ahead of its submission to parliament. The Cannabis for Private Purposes Bill comes after  a Constitutional Court ruling that legalised the personal use and cultivation of dagga in 2018. Here is what you need to know. Offences and penalties The bill deals with  personal use by an adult person and proposes  maximum jail time of 15 years for anyone who deals in dagga or provides it to a child — someone  under 18. Smoking dagga in public, too close to a window, or in the immediate presence of any non-consenting adult person could lead to a jail sentence of up to two years. Anyone smoking around children can get up to four years in jail. The draft law defined cannabis as anything that contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), including edibles, oils, and vaping liquid. Legal limits for personal use in private places The bill defines  “private places” as a building, house, room, shed, hut, tent, mobile home, caravan, boat or land or any portion thereof, to which the public does not have access as of right. Legal use at home: Amount allowed to carry in public spaces An adult person may, for personal use, possess 100g of dry dagga or one flowering plant in a public space. The draft also states that an adult person may, without the exchange of remuneration, provide to, or obtain from, another adult person, for personal use, the prescribed quantity of cannabis plant cultivation material, cannabis plant, or cannabis. A public place, as defined by the bill, means any place to which the public has access as of right. More information on penalties, quantities, and criminal offences can be found here.
