KTM Tech3's Miguel Oliveira became the first Portuguese rider to claim a MotoGP victory in the Styrian Grand Prix on Sunday in a race that was restarted after a horror crash involving Championship contender Maverick Vinales produced a red flag. Oliveira edged Pramac Ducati's Jack Miller and pole-sitter Pol Espargaro of KTM in a three-way battle on the final lap, sealing a first-ever premier class victory for the KTM Tech3 team. Earlier, Vinales was approaching turn one at around 140mph (225km/h) when he was forced to jump off his Yamaha due to a brake failure with the bike crashing into the air wall and bursting into flames.
