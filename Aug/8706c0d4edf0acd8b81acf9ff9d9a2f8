A suspected Eastern Cape rapist who allegedly abducted, raped and impregnated a teenager is due to appear in court on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni said the 26-year-old man was arrested on Monday after he was implicated in the case of the 18-year-old girl, who was abducted and raped at Mpheko Plantation locality in Mthatha​ while she was still 14 years old. She was pregnant at the age of 15. Tonjeni said the victim was sent to another locality by her mother when she was allegedly abducted and raped on the way by the suspect, who was 21 years old at the time. The victim reported the matter to Khula Community Project, which attended to the matter in collaboration with Mthatha FCS and Vispol. “The victim and her three-year-old daughter were rescued and are at a place of safety,” said Tonjeni. The suspect will appear before the Mthatha magistrate's court on Tuesday. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga commended the arrest. “We are a country founded on respect of human rights and supremacy of the law.
