The home affairs department in East London has come under the spotlight once again, with people having to stand in long queues because the system is down. I read with interest that it’s not the home affairs department that is at fault here, but Sita, the State Information Technology Agency. This does not solve the problem of having the public being told the system is down (for three days mind you) or long queues, where time and money are wasted, while hoping services will be rendered. But there is a solution, and a very easy, simple solution. Financial institutes like FNB, Absa, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Capitec all have biometric devices to identify and allow processing of home affairs documents to be captured and recorded. All it takes is for the department and Sita to set up a terminal point at each one of these institutions with home affairs clerks to capture and process information needed for applications for ID documents, birth certificates and passports. FNB in Johannesburg has already implemented this service, so why not in all major cities? Time and money will be saved and the public will receive the service they were intended to receive from public servants. — Marius Sardinha, via e-mail
