ANC NEC member and deputy minister of state security Zizi Kodwa has accused some of his comrades of occupying leadership positions in the party and government without possessing leadership qualities. Kodwa said this was the “rot within the party” which was chasing voters and “those who have the interest of the ANC at heart”, away from party politics. Kodwa was speaking in Mdantsane at the funeral service of ANC activist and Eastern Cape businessman Mzwandile “Tswayi” Poswa over the weekend, where he said unscrupulous leaders were only interested in acquiring personal wealth and boosting their own egos, at the expense of the party and good governance. asandan@dispatch.co.za
