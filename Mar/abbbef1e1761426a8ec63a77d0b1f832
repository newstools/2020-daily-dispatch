Sive Nontshinga scored a spectacular fifth round knockout of highly rated Filipino Ivan Soriano to retain his IBF intercontinental junior flyweight title at Orient Theatre on Sunday afternoon. The 21-year-old local came out boxing from a bobbing weaving style which would have made Vuyani Bungu proud. Despite possessing crippling power having knocked out all eight of his previous opponents, Nontshinga didn't madly rushed in. Instead he worked his jab while coming inside under bobbing and weaving style.Â His right would explode every time Soriano tried to attack. After a fierce exchange of punches in the fourth round, Nontshinga laid out Soriano with the right cross. The fight could have been waved over there and then but, Soriano was given the count which he barely beat. The bell came to his rescue. But Nontshinga nailed him again in the fifth sending him tumbling to his corner where he fell on the seat of his pants for a full count. It was a good win which should see his seventh IBF rating improve as he beat a boxer rated two rungs above him.
