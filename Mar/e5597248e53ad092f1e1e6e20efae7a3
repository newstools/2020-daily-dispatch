In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Pope Francis will live stream an extraordinary urbi et orbi blessing  to the world at 7pm  local time on Friday  to an empty St Peter’s Square. The blessing is usually only given on Christmas and Easter. “To the pandemic of the virus we want to respond with the universality of prayer, compassion and tenderness,” the Pope said. “Let’s stay united. Let us make those who are alone and tested feel our closeness,” as well as doctors, nurses, other healthcare workers and volunteers. “These days we are hearing the news of so many people who are dying, men and women who are dying alone without being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. Let us think about them and pray for them,” the pope said. “For families as well, who cannot accompany their loved ones on that journey, we pray in a special way for the dying and for their families,” he said.
