Police minister Bheki Cele on Monday announced the appointment of Patrick Setshedi as the acting executive director of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). Setshedi, a qualified accountant, was previously Ipid's chief financial officer. Cele made the announcement following the tenure of Victor Senna, who had been appointed acting Ipid head in March last year. "Mr Setshedi’s appointment emanates from the end of Mr Victor Senna’s acting period that ended at the end of February 2020. The minister has also acknowledged the positive work that Ipid did during the past 12 months. The minister wishes Mr Setshedi and Ipid well during his acting period," Ipid said.
