According to health MEC Sindiswa Gomba, the young man recently returned from a trip in America. She said suspicious neighbours and a member of a ward committee reported the man whom they suspected could be carrying the deadly virus to the ward councillor. The councillor then called Gomba. Gomba confirmed to DispatchLIVE that the she immediately assembled a team including doctors to inspect the suspected case. “I dispatched the team accompanied by police to make sure no-one is leaving the house. right now they are there and  we are now awaiting the outcomes of the raid.” Footage of police officers and health inspectors wearing powder-blue forensic suits and surgical masks is doing rounds and causing panic on social media. Gomba said: “This morning I received a tip off from the ward 24 councillor after hearing concerns about a member of community who recently returned from a trip in America and coughing badly and unfortunately his family were allegedly hiding him, not wanting him exposed.” The MEC added that the community, who had known about the man's return from the USA, had been wondering about his whereabouts. She said loud coughing gave him away and concerned community members raised the alarm and called their local councillor. This is a developing story. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
