The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) of South Africa is on a search for innovative solutions that can help solve some of the pressing challenges facing the country. On Tuesday, Statistics South Africa announced that the economy shrank 1.4% in the last quarter of 2019, pushing the country into recession. Last month, SA suffered numerous power cuts, drought continued in some parts of the country and students shut down a number of tertiary institutions demanding to be enrolled while carrying historic debt. These are just some of the challenges the UNDP Accelerator Lab, launched by higher education, science, and technology Blade Nzimande, wants to be solved through the participation of the public. To participate in this, the UNDP urged all to comment on its Twitter, Facebook page or via email to Acceleratorlabs.za@undp.org. "Tell us what your solution is, what challenge it seeks to address, how you conceived the idea for the innovation and if it's being used in your community or home," the UNDP said.
