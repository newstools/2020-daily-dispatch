It seems too often after a woman or child is murdered that nothing is done. For a few days our city is in uproar and the news is splashed everywhere. I ask  one simple question, not just to the courts of East London, but the president. Mr Ramaphosa, you came to East London and you promised the family of Angelique Clark Abrahams that her alleged killer would not get out on bail. But sadly he has been walking the streets of East London and still has visitation rights with his child who had to witness the brutal attack on Angelique. Where is the justice in that? â€” Debbie Scheepers, via e-mail
