Soldiers on foot were out in full force in parts of Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, on day 1 of the 21-day coronavirus lockdown on Friday. From about 4pm, a TimesLIVE reporter and photographerÂ  who had been tracking the soldiers from earlier in the day, joined them on their foot patrol about the township. With their white gloves on the barrel of their guns, the men in camouflage put on their blue surgical masks as they embarked on their patrol. Sitting outside his house, one elderly man continued to read his book, paying no attention to the approaching soldiers. Closing his book and lifting his chair, he told the soldiers off as they sternly told him to get inside his house.
