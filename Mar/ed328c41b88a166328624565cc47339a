Monthly prepaid data bundles of 1GB and below from MTN SA will, in April, cost from 25% to 50% less. Next month, MTN said on Friday, the 1GB monthly bundle will decrease by 33% to R99. The company said, “This continues the work MTN SA has done to improve the affordability of data for its customers, having already brought the effective rate of data on its network down by 76% between February 2017 and February 2020.” A week ago, its rival Vodacom announced it had reached an agreement with the country’s competition watchdog to reduce its mobile data prices - including cutting the cost of its 1GB monthly bundle from R149 to “no more than” R99, a 34% reduction, from April 1.
