A young East London man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping a 12-year-old relative last year. Wearing a grey jersey and black jeans, the Braelyn resident, 28, remained silent in the dock as judge  Nomathamsanqa Beshe handed down the sentence in the high court sitting in East London on Thursday. He was arrested in September after raping the girl between July and August at the family home. The girl gave evidence via a closed circuit television room. Sentencing the man, who cannot be named as that would identify the victim, Beshe said  the rape had taken its toll on the girl. Beshe described the rape as “deplorable and cruel”. “No child deserved what the accused did to the complainant, especially someone of her own flesh and blood,” she said. She said the accused deserved to be punished appropriately. The state applied for the accused to be registered on the sexual offence register. Beshe agreed and made that an order of the court. Beshe said the victim, who the court heard had lost her mother at a young age, was emotional and cried while giving evidence. The girl wrote a letter to her teacher at school detailing the sexual assault. “There is no sign she was imagining this. She came out on her own and disclosed it,” Beshe said. “Apart from her emotional state, she answered questions confidently. She was traumatised and avoided looking at the photo album. She said it reminded her of what happened.” Beshe said medical evidence corroborated the girl's testimony of penetration. “I am satisfied that the complainant's evidence is clear and satisfactory.”
