They will act in support of the police and be deployed initially around taverns in the northern areas where adherence to lockdown directives has been poor, according to sources The military police were drawn from various bases outside the Bay and the troops, with more arriving tomorrow, will be coming from the Makhanda infantry base. The military police arrived at the police 10111 call centre in Korsten in a small cavalcade of bakkies with flashing lights.
