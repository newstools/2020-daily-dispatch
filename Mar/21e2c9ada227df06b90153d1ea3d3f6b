Tuberculosis remains the number one killer in SA. In 2018, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) 2019 Global TB report showed that 301,000 people had succumbed to the disease in SA alone. This is why the WHO is imploring governments to ensure TB services are maintained during the Covid-19 outbreak. The WHO Global TB Programme, along with WHO regional and country offices, has developed an information note, in collaboration with stakeholders. This note is intended to assist national TB programmes and health personnel to urgently maintain continuity of essential services for people affected with TB during the  pandemic. The WHO has developed a checklist for those treating TB patients. Some of the key points are: Are people with TB likely to be at higher risk of Covid-19 infection, illness and death? People ill with Covid-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. Both diseases attack the lungs. Although both are transmitted mainly via close contact, the waiting period in TB is often longer. People with both TB and Covid-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if the  TB treatment is interrupted. What should health authorities do to support essential TB services during the Covid-19 pandemic? All essential TB services should be maintained throughout the Covid-19 emergency. People-centred delivery of TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services should be ensured in tandem with the Covid-19 response.
