A drive-through Covid-19 testing station opened on Thursday March 26 2020 at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. As pressure mounts for the  government to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the public and private health- care sectors are working together. Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced the first two Covid-19 related deaths in the country. Coronavirus cases in SA have now surpassed the 1,000 mark with  Friday being the first day of the national lockdown. The drive-through testing station is run by Health Insite in partnership with Mullah laboratories.  Health Insite says the testing station is not motivated by commercial gain but rather offers an alternative to standing in long queues at labs or state hospitals, which puts  people at risk.
