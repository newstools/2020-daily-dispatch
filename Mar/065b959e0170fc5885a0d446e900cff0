New restrictions imposed by the government on alcohol sales cost Eastern Cape taverns millions of rand in revenue in just one weekend. The Eastern Cape Liquor Forum’s Winston Hector described the impact of the ban on its 3,000 members as a “bloodbath”. The forum’s members include the owners of popular hangouts such as Mthombo’s, Fana’s and Man’s. The government announced last week that all taverns, clubs and restaurants selling alcohol must close between 6pm and 9am on weekdays, and  trade only between 9am and 1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. According to Hector, members recorded losses in revenue from  R50,000 for smaller taverns to R350,000 for bigger concerns. He said the ban not only affected  forum members but all 8,000 taverns in the province. “The [on-consumption] taverns should be allowed to sell alcohol beyond 6pm on a takeaway basis,”  Hector said. However, this  would require the Eastern Cape Liquor Board (ECLB) to issue taverns with temporary off-consumption liquor licences. ECLB chair Nontsikelelo Pakade rejected this  proposal. “You must remember the pronouncement was made by the national minister of Cogta [Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma] and as such we have to comply with that. “We cannot overrule what the minister has pronounced. “Ours is to ensure that all liquor licences that we have issued  comply with those regulations.” Hector said the regulations would destroy black-owned taverns in the townships. “This is devastating. We won't recover from the revenue losses.” The forum said while it would uphold strict hygiene conditions within all establishments, its members could not close their businesses at the new stipulated times. “SA must understand that while we respect and support the government’s call, tavern owners have bills to pay, car payments, bond payments, rent payments, council rates payments and staff salaries, and if we close our business at 6pm our families will suffer.” Hector said taverns would implement the following changes:
