Yanga Sigqibo scored a highlight reel seven rounds knockout of Filipino Cris Paulino to retain his WBO intercontinental junior bantamweight title at Orient Theatre on Sunday. The Duncan Village star showed no signs of being distracted after the bout was nearly stopped by his previous promoter Xaba Promotions in court on Saturday. This when XP challenged his featuring by Rumble Africa Promotions, arguing they still have a valid contract with him. However, the case was dismissed by Bhisho High Court with costs paving a way for Sigqibo to go ahead with the fight although it took almost the whole day for the weigh-in to be conducted due to delay by court proceedings. But on the day of the fight Sigqibo showed no effect of the court case, instead he exhibited a new boxing artistry looking sharp under the tutelage of new trainer Spokes Witbooi. After dominating the fight as he frustrated the left-handed visitor forcing him to commit fouls which costs him two deducted points, Sigqibo floored his foe in round six. Coupled with two deducted points, the knockdown set Paulino further behind with his only hope of winning being a knockout. This made him to be a bit caress as he looked to land one haymaker. When he lunged in Sigqibo laid him out with a right hand on his back as if a rug had been pulled under his legs. The manner in which Paulino's head hit the canvas forced referee Deon Dwarte to immediately stop the fight as medical personnel rushed into the ring. He laid on his back for close to five minutes.It was a fine victory for Sigqibo who commands lofty spots in two major world bodies.
