A man who assaulted, stabbed and raped an 80-year-old woman in Centane was this week sentenced to life imprisonment and an additional three-years for breaking into a her house to commit the crime. Aviwe Gxaweni, 37, was convicted and sentenced after being found guilty by the Centane regional court. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali told the Saturday Dispatch that according to evidence presented in court, the elderly victim was sleeping alone in her house in Tuturha village in Centane on April, 30, last year. “She was woken up by a sound of someone forcing the door open and she screamed,” he said. “Once the intruder got inside, he assaulted and stabbed the aged women before raping her.” The spokesperson said two youths from a neighbouring house heard the woman's screams and went to investigate. “Inside the old woman's house, they found a mean they identified as Gxaweni, who resided in the same neighbourhood.” They tried to apprehend him but we managed to fend them off and managed to escape. But he was later arrested. During the trial, Gxaweni pleaded not guilty and claimed he had been nowhere near the scene of the crime. However, state prosecutor Advocate Avumile Bikitsha was able to lead the evidence of the victim and the two neighbours who had come to her rescue. Subsequently the state requested the court to impose a harsh sentence. “Advocate Bikitsha revealed to the court that the NPA and SAPS have in the last five years, conducted numerous awareness campaigns aimed at putting a stop the surge in rapes committed against the elderly people by youths in the Centane area,” Tyali said. He said in Tuturha, the NPA had hosted two campaigns. Tyali said the NPA welcomed the sentenced given to Gxaweni. “We hope it will have the desired deterrence effect to other would-be criminals who prey on vulnerable women.” sikhon@dispatch.co.za
