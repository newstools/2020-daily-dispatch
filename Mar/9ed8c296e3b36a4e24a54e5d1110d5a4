The Nahoon Parkrun has stirred up much debate and heated discussion concerning a group of people who enjoy the run for its exercise and wonderful scenery. What really puzzles me though is the feigned concern of the authorities for the damaging impact if any the run supposedly has on this pristine area. To date I have never seen any parkrun participant entering this beautiful area with a pack of mongrels to decimate and maim any wild life there. I doubt very much that any of these runners leave behind tons of illegal refuse to pollute this beautiful area. Mr Mayor, please would you take the spot Light off the Nahoon parkrun and focus it on an equally beautiful area — namely the Umtiza Nature Reserve through the Buffalo Pass? Are you happy with the filth and illegal dumping alongside the road throughout this once pristine area? What does it take to get you to intervene and rescue this wonderful site that is crying out for help? We regularly have efficient and well-orchestrated road blocks, manned by our traffic department, to combat illegal drivers and extract money for outstanding fines. But what about the Umtiza dumping ground? A song by Joe Walsh says it all — “Is anyone out there? Does anyone listen or care any more? We are living on a dying planet, We’re killing everything that’s alive, and anyone who tries to deny it wears a tie and gets paid to lie.”  Please Mr Mayor, you have the power to intervene — do something before it’s too late! — Trevor Watson, Gonubie
