Restaurants, coffee shops and pubs  are grappling with the threat of a coronavirus outbreak in the Eastern Cape and are seeking to protect their employees and customers at every turn. Some establishments DispatchLIVE spoke to on Tuesday admitted business had slowed down as people feared going into public places at the moment. Melissa van Dyk, the manager at Jules On Jarvis in Berea, East London, said her staff routinely cleaned surfaces  such as door handles, menus, railings and chairs. “We are cautious. We tell our staff to wash their hands every 40 minutes. We wipe everything inside the restaurant with sanitisers,” Van Dyk said. She said business was not as busy as normal. “When a customer requests our employees to wear gloves when serving them, we wear them,” Van Dyk said. Mark Taylor, manager at All Places Tavern in Oxford Street, said he was constantly telling  customers and employees to take care of themselves. “My staff wear gloves and use sanitisers to clean their hands. There are sanitisers available for customers on request. "We try to keep our numbers low but it is difficult because we cannot chase people away. I have laid off some  staff because it is not as busy as it used to,” Taylor said. A restaurant manager who asked not to be  named as he does not have a mandate to speak to the media, said customers were provided with disposable cups, plates and utensils. Salt and pepper were now available in paper packets. The manager took the decision to close some sections of the restaurant to help keep customers safe and to lower the numbers inside the establishment. “Our waiters wear gloves all the time. Each table has its own bottle of sanitiser. For the safety of our employees, we are in the process of providing masks for them,”  Van Dyk. said
