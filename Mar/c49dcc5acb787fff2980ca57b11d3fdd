Health minster Zweli Mkhize has announced that there are four confirmed new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus infections in South Africa, bringing the total number of infected persons in the country to seven. Mkhize was speaking at a live inter-ministerial committee update on the coronavirus in South Africa. The minister said that the newly confirmed cases were all members of the same party of 10 that had recently travelled to Italy for a skiing holiday. Mkhize said that the group of 10 people who had travelled to Milan, seven had now tested positive. Another member of the group had not come back to South Africa and the results for the two others were still outstanding. Of the four newest cases, two are a 38-year-old couple from the uMgugundlovu area in KwaZulu-Natal, one is a 45-year-old male in Petermaritizburg and another is a 38-year-old male. He said that all members of the group had already been in quarantine for several days and the result had been expected. “There’ve been further numbers of people who were part of this team who were found to be positive. It would be noticed that these individuals had come in as couples and therefore we had asked them to be in quarantine already at the time when the first one turned out to be positive. Four of them have also now tested positive,” Mkhize said.
