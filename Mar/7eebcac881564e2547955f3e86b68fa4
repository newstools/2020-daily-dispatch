University of Fort Hare management has decided to shut down its campuses after a wave of disruptions, calling on police to help. In a leaked letter addressed to the police, the university management said its three campuses will be closed from Thursday "with immediate effect". The letter, which was widely shared on social media on Wednesday evening, said that failing to do so would put their "staff, students, contractors and property at risk". However, some students who commented on Facebook claimed that they were in the dark about the university'sÂ decision and had not been informed of the sudden closure.
