Yet another University of Fort Hare student has been killed, university management announced on Saturday afternoon. Alice-based student, Siphumle Nzo, was allegedly hit on the head with an iron bar by a fellow student last Saturday at the university's Marikana residence. He was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Alice where he was later transferred to Frere Hospital in East London. “Sadly, this morning he succumbed to his injuries. The university is in contact with the family,” said UFH director of institutional advancement Tandi Mapukata. A suspect was arrested for the murder remains in custody at the Alice police station, according to Mapukata. “The university will monitor the case and at the appropriate time, applicable disciplinary process will be meted out according to university policy,” Mapukata said. This is the third student death on the Alice campus since the beginning of 2020. Mapukata  said that the university's management “would like to take this opportunity to send heartfelt condolences to Mr Nazo’s family as well as the university community at large. We wish them courage during this dark hour”. The university promised that a range of  support services  would be provided to the family. “The university is doing all in its powers to discourage student-on-student violence,  and is in consultation with provincial authorities to devise methodologies to improve campus safety and prevent acts of violence on university property,” Mapukata said.
