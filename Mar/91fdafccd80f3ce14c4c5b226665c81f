According to claims data collected by Dialdirect Insurance, there has been a recent increase in vehicle theft in South Africa. The majority of vehicle thefts take place during the week and occur between the hours of 12pm and 6pm. “The spike follows a festive season lull indicating that criminals also take a break over the holidays. Now that 2020 is in full swing, criminals are back in force and we urge our customers to remain vigilant,” said Bianca De Beer from Dialdirect Insurance.
