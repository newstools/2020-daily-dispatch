It is with dismay that I noted the electrical wiring and fittings of all street lights in Pefferville had been stolen overnight. The time has come for BCM to install  floodlights here. Crime is beyond control, and drugs are sold as sweets on every street corner. The situation is going to worsen now with winter approaching. It will soon be dark when residents leave for work in the mornings and return in the evenings, and they will be more vulnerable to muggings and robberies. The dysfunctional street lights on the Black Road also need to be removed as they are subjected to theft and vandalism. — RD Claasen,via e-mail
