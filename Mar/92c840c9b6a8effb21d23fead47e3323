Chippa United coach Norman Mapeza dramatically resigned on Monday night, just less than two days after steering the team back to winning ways. While no one from management was immediately available to confirm the news, DispatchLIVE can reveal that club bosses and Mapeza were locked in a meeting for hours as they tried to convince him to stay. However the meeting failed to resolve the impasse which is believed to be stemming from the misunderstanding over the duties of the technical staff. Long serving Chippa United assistant coach Mbuyiselo Sambu will take over the reigns as the team prepares for an away league clash against Bidvest Wits on Saturday. "Yes I have been asked to take over the coaching duties until a new coach is found," said Sambu. Mapeza resigns just after steering the team to a 1-0 victory over Amazulu, breaking a five game winless streak which had piled pressure on him. Chippa are lying on 11th spot, five off the drop zone.
