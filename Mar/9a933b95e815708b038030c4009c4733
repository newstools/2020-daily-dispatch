On Tuesday, data released by Stats SA showed the South African economy entered its second recession in two years in the fourth quarter of last year. According to new GDP numbers, the economy declined by 1.4% from a revised contraction of 0.8% in the previous quarter. It managed growth of just 0.2%, down from 2018’s 0.8%. Stats SA said this marks the sixth consecutive year that SA’s economy has grown below 2% and the lowest level since 2009, when the economy contracted by 1.5%. Briefing the media in Tuynhuys, Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa said South Africans should not be shocked by the recession because the signs were there.

These included poor business and consumer confidence, and lack of production due to Eskom's load-shedding. “This technical recession has been there for all of us to see. It's been the load-shedding and the impact it has on production.” On social media, finance minister Tito Mboweni said: “The SA economy is strong enough to recover. We will work harder together”.
