Hollywoodbets Swallows reached the EC Super 14 rugby finals after emphatically edging out Ncera Leopards 30-20 at a packed NU 1 stadium in Mdantsane on Saturday afternoon. Leopards, who went into the encounter as underdogs started the game lively as they received two penalties within the first 5 minutes of the game. Leopards flyhalf Luvo Malgas who had a heavily strapped calf, missed both penalties and was substituted due to injury shortly after. Despite the early setbacks, Leopards took an early lead through winger Aphelele 'Serge' Bangani who capitalised from a sloppy pass from a Swallows centre. Swallows found form in the game when hooker Vuyisani Mavuso scored a try after a good scrum from the home side in the edge of Leopards try line. Swallows went into halftime leading 8-7. Leopards hopes of a comeback in the second half were dashed after early tries from Swallows left flanker Sokuphumla Xakalashe and a second try from Mavuso gave the home side the edge. Swallows Flyhalf Simanye Ziyokwana converted both penalties. Bangani scored his second try of the game to give leopards a chance in the dying minutes of the encounter but tries from Swallow's right flanker Billy Dutton and winger Buhle Magazi were enough to take the home side to the finals. Swallows coach Ntando Kebe praised his team for a good performance. “We played really well. We had some sloppy passes in the first minutes of game but we turned it around. I am proud of the fighting spirit showed by the boys today,” said Kebe. Swallows will face Caldis Progress in the final after the Uitenhage based club beat African Bombers 23-22. Mdantsane NU 1 stadium will host the final encounter after Swallows won the toss.
