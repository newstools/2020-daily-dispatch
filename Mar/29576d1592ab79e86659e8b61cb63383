The Eastern Cape has three more confirmed coronavirus cases — one in East London, one in Xhorha (Elliotdale) in the former Transkei and one in Port Elizabeth, the first case in the province's biggest metro. Just hours before the 21-day national lockdown came into effect at midnight on Thursday, premier Oscar Mabuyane told  DispatchLIVE of the three new cases, bringing the total to five in the Eastern Cape. The national health ministry on Thursday evening confirmed there were now five cases in the province. No further details were available at the time of writing. Those already confirmed to have the virus are a 28-year-old Mercedes-Benz employee from East London and a German tourist now isolated in Chintsa. soyisom@dispatch.co.za
