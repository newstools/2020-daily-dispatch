Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane wants former ANC MPL and struggle stalwart Mlungisi Ndamase to be afforded a special provincial official funeral. In a statement on Wednesday evening, Mabuyane's spokesperson Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha said the premier believes the former lawmaker was befitting of the honour. State funerals are afforded to citizens deemed to have made an impactful contribution in their field. Mabuyane said Ndamase, a former uMkhonto Wesizwe soldier, played an important role in the fight against the apartheid. "Premier Mabuyane will be engaging the presidency to approve a request for a special provincial official funeral for Mr Ndamase to honour the role he has played in the liberation of our country," Sicwetsha said. Should the request be approved, all SA flags would be ordered to fly at half mast until Ndamase is buried. The statement did not say what had killed Ndamase. DispatchLIVE reported on Tuesday that three ANC leaders had died between Monday and Tuesday. At the time, Ndamase's name was withheld as not all his relatives had not been notified of his death. The legislature also released a statement on Wednesday, describing Ndamase as a soft-spoken and humble person.
