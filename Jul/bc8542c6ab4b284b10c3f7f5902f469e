The JSE may take its lead from firmer Asian markets on Monday morning, while locally load-shedding is set to continue. Asian markets seem to be following Wall Street, which benefited on Friday from Covid-19 vaccine hopes, said Oanda analyst Jeffrey Halley in a note. Locally, news is less positive, with President Cyril Ramaphosa announcing the introduction of a 4am to 9pm curfew and the banning of liquor sales to contain Covid-19. Load-shedding is also expected to continue this week. In morning trade on Monday the Shanghai Composite was up 1.27% and the Nikkei 1.92%. Tencent, which gives direction to the JSE through Naspers, had firmed 0.27%. Gold was up 0.3% to $1,803.30 an ounce while platinum had risen 1.77% to R837.60. Brent crude was 0.67% lower at $42.50 a barrel. The rand was 0.2% firmer at R16.73 a dollar. There is little on the local corporate economic calendar on Monday, with inflation and mining data due later this week. Global focus is on corporate earnings reports and Covid-19 numbers.
