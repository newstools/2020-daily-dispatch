Bulelani Qholani was dragged naked out of a shack during an eviction by the city in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Wednesday morning. The footage capturing the incident was shared widely on social media and news media sites. Cape Town mayor Dan Plato apologised for the incident. However, after reviewing other videos of the incident, Plato said he believes that, to some extent, the event was staged. The city  has since suspended four officersÂ who were involved in the evictions, pending an investigation.
