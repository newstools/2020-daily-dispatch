“[Jacob] Zuma was selling the country for a plate of curry and [Cyril] Ramaphosa is selling the country for a glass of wine.” These remarks by EFF leader Julius Malema continue to dominate Twitter as South Africans respond to the speech he delivered on Sunday in commemoration of the opposition party's seventh anniversary.
