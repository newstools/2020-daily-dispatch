Former Western Cape premier  Ebrahim Rasool and media personality Majota “Phat Joe” Khambule​ have launched  OneAfrica Awards​ in a bid to honour “Africa excellence”. Rasool and Kambule are co-founders of OneAfrica — “a powerful new voice within the NGO sphere”. OneAfrica has partnered the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) and MultiChoice for the awards​. The awards show, which airs on Showmax as a seven-part series, showcase African individuals, communities, and NGOs “whose work enriches solidarity, social cohesion, and the economic advancement of the continent”. Each episode of the seven-part series features winners who have achieved excellence in entertainment, media, health, education, sustainability, traditional knowledge, and sports. Rasool said while some categories required deliberation and shortlists, others presented exceptional outliers whose outstanding accolades meritedclear, unanimously championed victory right from the outset. “We know that when Africans are made aware of the excellence within Africa by fellow Africans, pride is built and conflict gives way to greater understanding,” said Rasool. “Amid the unprecedented turmoil brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and global recession, now more than ever it is important that we work together to heal and grow the continent — as well as acknowledging those whose work enriches communities and fosters social solidarity.” While initially planned as a spectacular gala dinner, the OneAfrica Awards had been strategically reformulated due to the lockdown regulations to be an innovative series of televised broadcasts.
