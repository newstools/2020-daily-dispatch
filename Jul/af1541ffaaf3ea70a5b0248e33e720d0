Germany's Nico Hulkenberg will replace Racing Point driver Sergio Perez at this weekend's British Formula One Grand Prix after the Mexican was ruled out by a positive Covid-19 test result. Hulkenberg, a veteran of 177 grands prix, raced for the team when they were known as Force India and competed for Renault last season.
