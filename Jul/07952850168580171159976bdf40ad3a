Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders (ECHTL) provincial chair Nkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana was ousted in a vote of no confidence against him at Bhisho on Friday. Nonkonyana, who also the provincial Contralesa chairperson and NEC member, vowed to challenge his removal â€” even if it meant going to court. As the ECHTL chair and Contralesa provincial chair, Nonkonyana speaks for all traditional leaders and is able to influence the direction the provincial government takes. His axing does not affect his positions in Contralesa. Another ECHTL executive, Nkosi Vuyani Gwebindlala, was also voted out as the leader of the House. The decision to get rid of Nonkonyana and Gwebindlala was taken in Bhisho on Friday, when 25 members of the house voted for the move while seven were against it. Nkosi Xolile Ndevu and Nkosi Gwazinamba Matanzima said, among other things, Nonkonyana and Gwebindlala were removed for their failure to disclose to members of the house that they were still practising lawyers, despite occupying prominent government positions. Nkosi Langa Mavuso, ECHTL and Contralesa deputy chair, will be acting until a chairperson is elected.
