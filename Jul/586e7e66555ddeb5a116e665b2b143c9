Some disgruntled Springbok fans, angered by the uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement in sport, have shared videos of themselves burning and ripping up their jerseys to protest against the movement. Many of them said they wanted politics kept out of sport. Over the past few weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement struck a deep chord in SA after Proteas' fast bowler Lungi Ngidi called for solidarity in cricket and for the team to address the BLM movement. Ngidi's stance  prompted a major reaction, with many other sportsmen sharing the racial encounters they had experienced on the sporting field. Springbok captain Siya Kolisi shared his experience, opening up about how he  felt excluded at times during his rugby career. SA Rugby vowed to support Kolisi by taking steps to address the grievances of black players. SA Rugby chief Jurie Roux ​said it was time for those “uncomfortable conversations” about systemic and integrated discrimination. While there has been support for the BLM movement, former soccer player Mark Fish said he was a firm believer that all people mattered and that all lives matter. Fish said he sees the world “through God's eyes” and doesn’t “conform to this world”. He also suggested that  black lives will only matter when black people treat other black people correctly in South Africa. After criticism, Fish apologised for the offence his comments caused and denied that he was racist.
