World Rally Championship (WRC) organisers cancelled Argentina's postponed round on Thursday while announcing the season, halted by the Covid-19 pandemic, would restart in Estonia in September. It will be the first time Estonia, home of reigning world champion Ott Taenak, has featured on the WRC calendar. The short-format gravel rally based around Tartu is scheduled for September 4-6. The revised schedule published on Thursday sees Turkey following on from Estonia on September 24-27. Germany's round will be on October 15-18, with Italy (Sardinia) on October 29 to November 1 after being postponed from June. Japan is scheduled to end the season on November 19-22. Rallies in Belgium and Croatia could also feature, with talks ongoing. The championship completed three rounds in Monte Carlo, Sweden and Mexico before the coronavirus sent countries into lockdown. Six-time world champion Sebastien Ogier leads the standings for Toyota. "Todayâ€™s restart announcement sends a clear signal that the 2020 WRC is back in business," said WRC Promoter managing director Oliver Ciesla in a statement. FIA rally director Yves Matton said he was confident there would be a minimum of eight rallies this year.
