Mexican Formula One driver Sergio Perez was self-isolating on Thursday after an inconclusive test for Covid-19, the governing FIA said at the British Grand Prix. A spokesperson for the Silverstone-based Racing Point team said Perez, who was awaiting the result of a re-test and not at the circuit, had not been back to Mexico since he last raced in Hungary on July 19.
