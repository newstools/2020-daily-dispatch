The DA in the Eastern Cape has approved the plan to have its elective congress virtually. This was confirmed to DispatchLIVE by the party's provincial chair, Andrew Whitfield, who said the plan was “unanimously approved” by the provincial executive council on Monday. Whitfield said the elective congress would be on August 21. “It was unanimous by one abstention, so it received overwhelming support so we move forward,” he said. Whitfield said more than 300 delegates will be part of the congress with the party having dry runs this month and in early August. Those with connectivity problems will gather in separate venues under strict lockdown regulations with social distancing, Whitfield said. He and provincial MD Elmarie Botha were in May tasked with investigating the feasibility of electing new members online and reported back on Monday. The congress will only elect new leaders and will not have debates, resolutions and amendments to the constitution.
