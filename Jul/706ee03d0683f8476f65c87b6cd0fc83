The Eastern Cape Health Department is in a serious crisis and on the verge of collapse. President Ramaphosa cannot close his eyes any longer. The lives of people are at stake. It is total chaos in hospitals and clinics, health workers, doctors, nurses and support staff are complaining that they cannot take the pressure anymore. They are exhausted, there is a shortage of doctors, nurses and general workers. What is worse is the lack of PPEs. All of them have one common complaint - lack of political leadership and rampant corruption in the department. The MEC of Health, Sindiswa Gomba, is incapable and is totally clueless. She is not suitable for the position. She has failed the province. This is not only the complaints of the health workers but the entire province is up in arms. It is the responsibility of the President of the country to intervene in a Province where a crisis is identified and the lives of the people are in danger. It is COPE's view that the only solution to address the problems of the Eastern Cape is to urgently place it under Administration. It will be in the best interest of the people of the Eastern Cape.
