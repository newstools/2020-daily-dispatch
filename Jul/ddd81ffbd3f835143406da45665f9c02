World champion Marc Marquez made his remarkable return four days after surgery in Saturday's Andalucia MotoGP third practice with Maverick Viñales setting a track record at Jerez to top the time sheets. Marquez sat out Friday's two opening sessions to conserve his energy for qualifying later on Saturday. The 27-year-old Honda star had been declared fit to race on Thursday despite an operation just 48 hours earlier on a broken arm sustained in a heavy crash in last Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix opener, also at Jerez. Marquez is hoping to qualify for the second leg of the coronavirus-disrupted season later on Saturday. He posted a time that left him 20th, 1.3 seconds behind Yamaha's Vinales, who lowered Fabio Quartararo's circuit record set last weekend with a time of 1 min 36.584 seconds. Quartararo, who became the first French MotoGP winner since 1999 when he took the delayed season-opener, posted the second quickest practice time ahead of Ducati's Australian rider and Japan's Takaaki Nakagami for Honda's LCR satellite team.
