AmaRharhabe nation is mourning the death of its monarch, Queen Noloyiso Sandile,  on Wednesday afternoon. The 56-year-old queenâ€™s death was confirmed by AmaRharhabe spokesperson Prince Xolile Burns-Ncamashe. Noloyiso was the sister of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. "Her Majesty passed on after 1pm. She was admitted at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital," Burns-Ncamashe said. "We are mourning the sudden departure of Her Majesty and the whole kingdom is shocked." Burns-Ncamashe said all media inquiries would be dealt with by the AmaXhosa's Nkosi Xhanti Sigcawu. Queen Noloyiso has been reigning since 2011 following the death of her husband, King Maxhoba Sandile. Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders and Contralesa chairperson Nkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana conveyed condolences to both the Sandile and the Zulu royal families. "She is known to us as a leader who clearly understood the institution of traditional leadership in South Africa and a woman who was proud of being an African woman and has proved that women, when given a responsibility, would perform such responsibility with distinction as she has done," Nonkonyana said. Nonkonyana said they would support both families during this time "and hope she will be given the dignified funeral that she deserves".
