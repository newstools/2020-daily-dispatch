A self-taught Grahamstown artist Akhona Mlisana has paid tribute to the fallen legendary actress Mary Twala with a magnificent drawing. Twala, 80, died in Johannesburg over the weekend. The actress, who is the mother of popular radio and TV personality Somizi "Somgaga" Mhlongo, was laid to rest on Thursday. Mhlongo was quoted on social media as saying he would like "to do something big for seven artists who did sketches of his mother". Mlisana's drawings have gone viral on social media. He said he saw fit to pay tribute to Twala through art. "It's a tribute to an artist by an artist," he said. Mlisana lost his job during the Covid-19 lockdown crisis. He is now hoping to focus on mastering his artistic skills. "I neglected my talent while I was working.Â  I was only drawing during my spare time," he added.
