SA is mourning the death of acting royalty Mary Twala who died on Saturday — and in their sadness they've also shared the affect she, through her talent, had on their lives. The 80-year-old legendary actress died on Saturday at Netcare Park Lane Private Hospital around 11am. While Mzansi is heartbroken at the news of the iconic actress's death, just like her son Somizi they are comforted by the thought that Mary lived a full and impressive life. Fans of the award-winning actress celebrated her life and everything that she was to different people. Mzansi loved Mary because the world-renowned actress was humble and  whenever she spoke, fans realised how wise she was. Through Mary and her equally talented late husband, Mzansi and the world also have Somizi, who continues to slay in every single thing he does. His work ethic and passion can be attributed to his mother, who  never missed a beat in her work. Mary  had an extensive career as an actress, performing in roles in film, television and theatre,  over six decades. As an artist, Mary's resume is unmatched and her consistency in delivering top-notch work has been a marvel for her audience to watch. Her film career includes such international films as Sarafina!, Deliwe and Taxi to Soweto — for which she won a Best Supporting Actress award. The list of her performances in  TV productions  is  long  and includes major productions such as Undenzani Melwane, Iqhawe, Hlala Kwabafileyo, Soul Buddyz, Child Of Soweto, Khululeka, Yizo-Yizo, SOS and Muvhango. SA definitely knew the gem they had in the actress and gave her the due recognition in 2019. Mary received the Order of Ikhamanga for her decades-long work in the performing arts. The order also honoured  Mary for her work in raising awareness of women's health through her work. A tree has indeed fallen, lala ngoxolo Mary.
