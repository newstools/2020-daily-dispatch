World champion Lewis Hamilton won Sunday's Styrian Grand Prix as Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas finished second. The paddock seemed to be split again pre-race as some drivers were absent as Hamilton led the protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Finland's Bottas remains top of the drivers standings after winning last weekend's opening race of the season.
