Speeding, reckless, negligent and drunken driving were blamed after nine people died on Eastern Cape roads over the weekend. In addition to the weekend fatalities, another three people died while two sustained injuries in two separate road accidents in Elliotdale and Dutywa on Tuesday night. “Two passengers lost their lives when the driver of a bakkie with four occupants lost control in Mqanduli on the Khwenxurha gravel road towards Qunu near Mthatha at 6.45pm. The two passengers — both males — died on the scene. The driver and one passenger sustained severe injuries,” said provincial transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose. The injured were rushed to Madwaleni Hospital in Elliotdale. Mechanical failure and speeding were contributing factors to the accident, Binqose said. In the second accident, a woman died when a vehicle overturned near Ngcingwana village on the R408 road between Dutywa and Willowvale at about 9pm on Tuesday. “The wreckage was only discovered this morning (Wednesday) with the body of the female driver. The vehicle rolled several metres off the road making it difficult for it to be spotted,” said Binqose. With the festive season just around the corner, Binqose urged motorists to drive cautiously.
