East London’s star waveski surfer Bruce Viaene became the new US Open Waveski champion at the Ventura Paddle Surfing Championships on Friday. Vaiene took the top honours in a novel virtual format that pitted him against some of the world’s best waveski exponents, and brings him his second major title within a week. Viaene won the Western Province Open  last weekend, winning the crown for the second year in a row. It has now been announced that he  clinched the coveted US Open Waveski title, beating competitors from all over the world with an 18.10 combination score, narrowly closing out  world No 2 Virgile Humbert from France. The Ventura Paddling Surfing Championships co-ordinated a first of its kind for the sport; a virtual online waveski competition in which athletes from France, Australia, America and many other countries took part. The entrants were required to submit video footage of themselves surfing, recorded during the month of October. These videos were judged by three international judges. Viaene took on the challenge and ventured down the coast to Jeffery’s Bay to surf the well-known breaks of the area and gather the necessary footage for the competition. “It’s been a tough year, but I am thankful to my sponsors and supporters who have continued to encourage me, and to Macski Waveski who have always made it possible for me to chance my dreams,” said  Viaene. He is now in full preparation for the  coming KZN Waveski Open, scheduled to take place on  December 12 and 13, and hopes to walk away  with another title. — GamePlan Media
