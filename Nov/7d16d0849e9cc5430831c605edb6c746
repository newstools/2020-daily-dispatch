Four-year-old Yonela Ntantiso was killed on Friday morning after she wasÂ  electrocuted by illegal connections while playing with her friends. The young girl was climbing a tree when she accidentally grasped a live electrical wire. The cables hang from the tree and connected to houses by Izinyoka. Her body was found at around 8.30am in Second Creek after the panicked screams of her friends alerted residents to the tragedy. Ntantiso's burnt body was still in the tree, wrapped with the loose cabling. Neighbour Ishmael Ricketts tried to resuscitate Ntantiso but it was too late.
