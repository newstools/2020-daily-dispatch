The dollar steadied against many currencies on Friday but traders say more losses are likely as a contentious US presidential election diminished hopes for large stimulus to support the economy any time soon. Investors are betting that Democrat Joe Biden will become the next president but Republicans will retain control of the Senate, which will make it difficult for the Democrats to pass the larger fiscal spending package they have been pushing. Biden maintains an edge over President Donald Trump, but a few important states are still counting votes and Trump is mounting legal challenges to vote counts, so there is still a high degree of uncertainty. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 92.641, close to a two-week low. For the week, the dollar index was down 1.5%, on course for its biggest drop in almost four months. -Reuters The US Postal Service said about 1,700 ballots had been identified in Pennsylvania at processing facilities during two sweeps Thursday and were in the process of being delivered to election officials.In a court filing early Friday, USPS said about 1,070 ballots, had been found at the USPS Philadelphia Processing and Distribution Center.
