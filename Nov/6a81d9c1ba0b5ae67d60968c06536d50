Deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo heard arguments calling for   his recusal from the commission of inquiry into state capture on Monday. Zondo opened the proceedings by reading a  statement in which he addressed  allegations brought against him through  former president Jacob Zuma's legal team. Zuma  claimed that  he and  the commission's chairperson were friends, arguing that this resulted in a conflict of interest. Zuma also accused Zondo of not being impartial during  proceedings. Zondo  denied having a friendship with the former president. “Though Mr Zuma and I have a cordial relationship, Mr Zuma’s statement that we are friends is not recorded accurately. He has never been to any of my residences and I have never invited him,” Zondo said. The deputy chief justice heard arguments by Zuma's lawyer, Muzi Sikhakhane, and the commission's evidence leader  Paul Pretorius on the matter. The commission was adjourned and resumes on Tuesday at 10am. TimesLIVE
