UDM deputy chairperson and MPL Mcedisi Filtane has died to Covid-19 on Sunday morning. His death was confirmed by UDM leader Bantu Holomisa on the party’s official Facebook page. Holomisa wrote: “Tragedy has struck: UDM deputy chairperson and MPL, Mncedisi Filtane has passed away this morning due to Covid-19. We are terribly shocked by this loss as we now try to console the Filtane family. May his soul rest in peace.” Filtane is the second UDM leader to die from Covid-19 related illness this month after former Nelson Mandela Metro mayor Mongameli Bobani died at St Georges Hospital last week.
