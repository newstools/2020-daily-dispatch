Yet another child was electrocuted by illegal connections in East London on Monday afternoon. Leeroy Mara, 12, died tragically while playing with his friends at Muvhango informal settlement in Egoli Extension. His lifeless body was found by residents at a nearby dumpsite. A community leader Ronnelle Pitt said 13 people had lost their lives due to illegal connections there since 2013. The last time tragedy struck was in November last year. “We feel neglected by the government ... our cries are falling on deaf ears. How many children must die in order for them to take us seriously,” said Pitt. A week ago Yonela Ntantiso, a four-year-old girl from Second Creek, died after being electrocuted by Izinyoka cables while playing with her friends. DispatchLIVE
