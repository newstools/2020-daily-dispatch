Police have launched a manhunt for the perpetrators who allegedly petrol-bombed nine trucks on the N3 and R103 near Heidelberg on Thursday night. Gauteng police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said preliminary investigations revealed that a white Toyota Quantum and a black VW vehicle, both with unknown registrations, had blocked the road. Then a number of trucks caught fire after petrol-bombs were allegedly thrown at them. This occurred at about 8.30pm on Thursday. “Seven trucks were torched on the N3 between Heidelberg and Vosloorus while two trucks were set alight on the R103.” Police said the motive for the torching could not immediately be confirmed. “Police are investigating cases of malicious damage to property and are appealing to anyone who might have information that can lead to the apprehension of the suspects to please call the nearest police station or the crime stop number on 08600 10111.” Acting provincial commissioner Maj Gen Patricia Rampota has ordered the urgent mobilisation of maximum resources towards finding the perpetrators responsible.
