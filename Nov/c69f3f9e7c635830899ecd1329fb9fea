Prime Minister Boris Johnson is confident Britain will prosper even if his negotiating team are unable to strike a trade deal with the European Union, a statement from his office said on Monday. "The Prime Minister has been clear that we will not accept any proposals in the negotiations that undermine our status as a sovereign, independent country and if the EU donâ€™t respect the sovereignty of the UK we will leave on Australian terms and the Prime Minister is confident that we will prosper," the statement said.
