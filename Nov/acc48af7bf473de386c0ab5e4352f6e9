Police have arrested two Lesotho nationals who are linked to a 2019 murder at New Rest locality in Maclear. The suspects, who are accused of killing a 25-year-old man, were arrested in Ngcobo and Ixopo in KwaZulu-Natal. “It is alleged that the two suspects and the victim were renting rooms in the same house, and while enjoying themselves, a quarrel started between them and the two suspects fatally stabbed the deceased,” said police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci. “The two suspects , who are allegedly from Lesotho, fled the country and could not be traced. After a long attempt to extradite them from their country of origin, on 14 November 2020, information was received by K9 Elliot members that the suspects had returned to SA.” The pair, Tshetshane Nkoata, 24, and Somandla Ndaba, 25, were both charged with murder and appeared at the Maclear magistrate's court on November 17. The case was postponed to November 26 for a formal bail application. DispatchLIVE
