The commission of inquiry into state capture will continue to hear  testimony relating to Denel from  former  group CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe and current GCEO  Tlib Sadik, as well as Stephan Burger and  Daniel Mantsha. TheÂ  commission  on  Wednesday heard testimony from  Ntshepe who said he believed he had the power to deviate from the company's supply chain management policy to approve a single-supplier contract between Denel Land Systems (DLS) and Gupta-linked company VR Laser. He was being questioned on why he overruled a decision by Denel group executive for supply chain management Dennis Mlambo, who had refused to approve the single-supplier contract. Evidence leader Paul Kennedy told Ntshepe that a former contracts manager at DLS, Celia Malahlela, had indicated that Mlambo had refused to approve the request in 2015.
