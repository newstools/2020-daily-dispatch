The Eastern Cape provincial government on Monday confirmed the outbreak of brown locust  in Chris Hani and Sarah Baartman districts. Department of rural development and agrarian reform MEC Nomakhosazana Meth said systems were put in place to successfully manage the pests. “Spraying with knapsacks and bakkie pump sprayers has already started and farmers are continuously being trained as guided by the Locust Policy of South Africa (1998) to ensure that they are well equipped in adhering to insecticide protocols regarding their use, handling and storage, including dosages needed per hectare,” she said. The provincial department has compiled a list of emerging farmers in the affected districts who will be trained so that they can participate in the management of the pests before the swarms reach the flying stage. “Whilst officials are also busy scouting, farmers are once more urged to report any new outbreak to extension officers in their local and districts offices so that they can receive help and participate in the management of the pest in their farms,” Meth said. State entomologists in the province have joined forces with the national department of agriculture, land reform and rural development ​to tackle the outbreak. The known affected areas include Middelburg Cape, Graaff-Reinet, Aberdeen, Cradock, Nieu-ethesda, Pearston and Jansenville on 127 farms. DispatchLIVE
