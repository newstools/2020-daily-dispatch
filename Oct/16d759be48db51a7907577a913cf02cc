Following the global outbreak of  Covid-19,  nations including  SA  have responded by imposing  lockdowns to curb the surge of infections.  Pandemics  affect national economies through several channels, including the health, transportation, agricultural and tourism sectors, while trade  is  affected through interruptions in international supply chains.  Pandemics hinder economic growth which in turn affects  government revenue and expenditure. At household level, death or illness of a family breadwinner results in direct losses of income leading to a reduction in savings as time and resources are spent on  treatment, extra hygiene measures and  nutrition to boost immune systems. Reductions in savings lead to disinvestment in human capital, notably the education of children, and to  loss of productive assets, including land or housing. One lesson  from the  pandemic is that  attempts  made by the private sector in disease prevention and control may not be sufficient. This provides justification for governments to intervene in health programmes to achieve optimal  levels for disease control, and optimum mix of prevention and control. Covid-19  has also highlighted the need for comprehensive strategies and strong political will for  governments to be proactive in  efforts to curb the rate of infections and put in place practical,  sustainable programmes to prevent, manage, and control diseases. Concerted pro-action is  paramount for all nations to guard against the threat of epidemics, and their potential progress into pandemics, and to mitigate their impact. - Ntombimbini Mdlulwa, via e-mail
