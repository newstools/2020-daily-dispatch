A high court application which sought to immediately implement a judgment ordering the dissolution of the Makana municipal council has been refused. Judge Igna Stretch on Thursday dismissed the so-called section 18 application brought by the Unemployed People’s Movement in terms of which the UPM sought to have her earlier judgment ordering the dissolution of the council immediately implemented despite a pending appeal being lodged with the Supreme Court of Appeal. Stretch earlier this year ordered the provincial executive to “forthwith” dissolve the inefficient and ineffective Makana council and appoint an administrator until a new council was elected within three months. She ruled the municipality had consistently contravened the constitution by failing to sustainably provide services to the community or to structure and manage its administration, budget and planning process. Both the province and the municipal council have appealed the decision. The SCA yesterday granted them leave to appeal. Judge Stretch said she would give reasons for her judgment if required to do so by the parties involved in the matter. DispatchLIVE
