Two allegedly bogus Eastern Cape doctors were arrested by the Hawks and police on Tuesday  for practicing medicine without valid licence or the necessary qualifications. The duo was arrested in an operation in Butterworth, where they are accused of running an illegal medical practice. Police seized medication and used syringes at the surgery for further investigation, while the search continued at the East London home of the two accused. The pair is set to appear before the Butterworth Magistrate's Court on Thursday to face an array of charges for violating the Health Professions Act, other related medical Acts, fraud, forgery and money laundering. The takedown operation was led by the Hawk’s serious commercial crime investigation team, assisted by Butterworth crime intelligence, SAPS police forensic sciences laboratory and the health professions council of SA. It is alleged that the suspects started operating the surgery in January 2019 at Bongalo Mall in Butterworth. Their clients were mostly pensioners around Butterworth, Dutywa, Ngqamakwe, Willowvale and Centane. The pair allegedly also issued fake sick certificates and dispensed medication to their clients without the necessary qualifications and licence. DispatchLIVE
