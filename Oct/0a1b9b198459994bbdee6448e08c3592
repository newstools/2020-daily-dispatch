Police are asking members of the public to come forward with any information that can assist in their investigations into the brutal rape and murder of little Ayabukwa "Nhathi" Mhlahlo. The child’s lifeless body was discovered in Mdantsane on Monday. Provincial police commissioner lieutenant-general Liziwe Ntshinga had ordered a 72 hour activation of all resources to bring a speedy finalisation of the investigation and the arrest of those implicated, police said on Thursday night. “SAPS management has also ordered senior officers, including the station commander to visit the family of the young girl. The family, and in particular the mother of the deceased child, is in constant communication with the investigating officers who provide her with regular updates on the progress made in the process of investigations,” said police spokesperson brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana. Meanwhile, police have slammed social media reports suggesting the Vulindlela station commander does not care about the investigation. “Such scurrilous reports have also been dismissed by the mother of the child who described these allegations as nothing more than calculated lies aimed at sowing a seed of discontent and confusion between the police and the bereaved family,” Kinana said. Ntshinga said misinformation could not only mislead investigators, but also “demoralise and make families lose confidence on the ability of the police to crack the case”. She appealed to the community to give the detectives a chance to do their work. “This is a very sensitive matter which must not be used to invoke emotions and public ire. The family deserves respect so they can eventually find peace.” DispatchLIVE
