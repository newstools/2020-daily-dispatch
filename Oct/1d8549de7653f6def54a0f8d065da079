An intelligence-driven operation by East London police’s crime intelligence and visible policing units netted four business robbery and bank card scam suspects from KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. Two men and two women were arrested  in possession of suspected stolen property. Police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni said: “It is  alleged that the suspects, aged between 23 and 38, booked accommodation at one of the local establishments. “Police, upon searching the premises, found clothing suspected to have been stolen with an estimated value of R25,000. The clothing was  from different stores. Two cellphones were recovered and seized.” A hired vehicle allegedly used to commit the crimes was also confiscated, he said. “All suspects will appear in the East London magistrate’s court on Monday on charges of possession of suspected stolen property. However, the possibility of more charges [being added] cannot be ruled out.” Eastern Cape provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga commended the police officers for the arrests. “The arrest of the suspects is a major breakthrough as the suspects could have continued with their spree the entire weekend if they were not stopped in their tracks,” she said. “All these suspects will be profiled to ascertain if they could not be linked to similar crimes across the province and the country.” DispatchLIVE
