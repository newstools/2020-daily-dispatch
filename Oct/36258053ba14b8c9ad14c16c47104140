Idols SA 2013 winner Musa Sukwene describes his latest single, Thandiwe, as a realisation of how people  survive the Covid pandemic with the people they love. The single is a lead-up to his fourth studio album, which is set to drop early in 2021. Sukwene said he planned to go  acoustic in the upcoming album. “Thandiwe is basically a song I wrote for people who managed to survive  this pandemic,” he said. “It brings realisation to relationships; a lot of them went through so much trouble during this period. “Finances changed,  people and time became factors.” Sharing his experiences as a musician during the  pandemic, Sukwene said coming from a creative space, his biggest concern was  lack of inspiration in producing and creating music. “The financial squeeze was also a big issue. “Working alone allowed me the space to speak independently and to reference the music I loved. “I searched for all SA sounds and our heritage that we can’t pretend  we don’t know. “And also, to share the story of love with  young and old and cross all the gaps without making anyone uncomfortable”, Sukwene said. Thandiwe picks up where Sukwene and late legendary composer Robbie Malinga left off with Mthande, a song that tells the story of a lover who sticks by his sweetheart’s side through thick and thin, even when everything seems to be going wrong. It follows the success of his self-titled album Musa, which dropped in 2018. Before that came Mr Serious in 2016, which made history when it went triple platinum, and before that, The Dream in 2014.
