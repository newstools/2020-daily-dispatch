Former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo was stabbed on Saturday morning, his official Twitter account said on Sunday. The shot-stopper — who also has three Bafana Bafana caps — was taken to hospital. “Brilliant Khuzwayo was invited to speak at the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) sports event. Right before he could make his address, a male, believed to be a MUT student, stabbed him and he was rushed to the hospital. A case has been opened with Umlazi SAPS,” the Twitter post read. Further details have not been provided, and TimesLIVE has reached out to KwaZulu-Natal  police for say on the incident. This is a developing story.
