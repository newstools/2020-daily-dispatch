Miss South Africa 2018 Tamaryn Green visited East London on Saturday to hand over a cheque to the Uyinene Mrwetyana Foundation (UMF). The Mrwetyana family and friends were present at the event. Green, who is a medical doctor, said as a woman living in SA, she too lives in fear everyday of rape, abuse and being murdered. “It's time to speak up and SA is high with GBV rates and its time to hold men accountable in society. If we stick together, we can make it an achievable goal,” she said. One of Green's inspirations for standing up and lending a hand to the UMF is a patient of hers who came in with horrific GBV related injuries. “I had a patient in hospital with a horrific story of GBV where she had to have ample operations,” said Green, who was also the Miss Universe 2018 runner up. “She is a lovely lady who shared her story and I’m proud of her, as she went through a huge ordeal and she wanted to share her story and help others,” she added.
