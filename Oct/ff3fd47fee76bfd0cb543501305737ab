A humpback whale was washed up between Bonza Bay and Nahoon coastline on Monday, according to a media advisory by Buffalo City Metro. The metro warned that the carcass is decomposing to a point that can attract sharks, resulting in a high shark activity in the area and therefore advised peopleÂ  to avoid it. The municipality said that, as per level 1 Covid-19 regulations, public beaches are still closed for swimming, therefore natural processes have been allowed to take place as the removal of the carcass is not financially feasible.
