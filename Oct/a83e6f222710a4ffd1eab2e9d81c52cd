Zambia beat South Africa 2-1 in an international friendly at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg on Sunday. After Keagan Dolly replaced the injured Lyle Foster in the opening minute, Bafana pushed for an early lead after Percy Tau unleashed a free-kick from outside the area, but Zambian goalkeeper Sebastian Mwange scrambled across to gather. Zambia began to find confidence after a slow start and brought Motjeka Madisha to an emphatic goal-line clearance inside the midway point with Darren  Keet in no man’s land. Tau sprung the host to life after the half-hour mark when his left-footed shot from range forced Mwange to palm for a corner-kick, with Madisha sending the resultant corner over the crossbar. Chipolopolo cut open the South Africans minutes before halftime when Lubambo Musonda cracked the foot of the post after a low shot from the right. Following a quiet spell, Bafana found the opener inside the 65th minute when Dolly beat Mwange to Tau’s through ball to prod into an unguarded net. Zambia came to life again 13 minutes from trailing, and drew level when Kelvin Kampamba pulled a cutback from the far side of the area to drill into the bottom corner. The turnaround was complete in the last eight minutes when Chaniza Zulu latched onto Ghampani Lungu’s scuffed shot to tuck into the roof of the net. Bafana were not able to launch a comeback thereafter as Chipolopolo managed the closing minutes to wrap up the win.  — DDC
