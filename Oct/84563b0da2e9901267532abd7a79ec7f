Buffalo City Metro authorities  are negotiating with Chippa United, a football club located in Port Elizabeth, for the lease of the Buffalo City and Jan Smuts Athletic  stadiums. Yet, not one of the sports clubs in East London  have a lease as all leases between the metro  and sports clubs  have expired and the municipality is  refusing to enter into new leases. How can we develop sports in the city if clubs do not have a lease on the land. If sports clubs apply for funding, funders want to know if they have a right to the land. We kindly ask BCM to treat all sports clubs in the metro in the same manner as Chippa United — negotiate with them for a lease on the land they occupy or use. — Christo Theart, chair,  Centre for Local Community Rights
