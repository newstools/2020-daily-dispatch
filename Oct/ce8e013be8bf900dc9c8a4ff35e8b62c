The  Nelson Mandela Museum reopens to   the public  on Monday after being closed for six months in accordance with national coronavirus lockdown regulations. Staff  were excited about the reopening, said museum spokesperson Nontlahla Tandwa-Dalindyebo. “We welcome the government endorsement to open the Nelson Mandela Museum’s doors to local, provincial, national and international tourists. Government regulations and measures imposed on international travellers when arriving in the country will help prevent the spread of Covid-19. “As a museum we have put in place measures to combat the spread of Covid-19,” Tandwa-Dalindyebo said. “The announcement of the total shutdown in March led to a closure of all SA borders. It had a negative effect on tourism and the hospitality sector. The Nelson Mandela Museum was also affected, but this prompted us to come with alternative ways of sparking interest among international and national tour operators. “The museum used its social media platforms and the website to post virtual exhibitions and tours to keep tourists abreast of what to see after lockdown.” She said  the Nelson Mandela Museum's Bhunga building in Owen Street, Mthatha, would be fully operational again from Monday. The museum  will be open to visitors from 9am-2pm, Monday to Friday. On Saturday,  it will be open from  9am-1pm. The premises will be closed on Sunday except in cases of advance bookings. Tandwa-Dalindyebo urged people thinking of a village tour to make bookings in advance.
