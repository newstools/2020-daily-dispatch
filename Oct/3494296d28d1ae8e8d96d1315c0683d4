The man who was arrested for dangling a one-year-old baby from a footbridge near East London’s Steve Biko bridge on Monday has been in trouble with the law before. That is according to a Second Creek ward committee member who spoke to DispatchLIVE on Monday night. “He is known in this community. He has cases against him,” the ward committee member said. DispatchLIVE understands the man is the baby's uncle. Drama unfolded on Monday at about lunchtime on Monday when members of the Red Alert Security armed response team, together with members of community, saved the baby from the man’s clutches. The man then fled into the cliffs above Settler’s Way, threatening to jump. With traffic brought to a standstill and more than 100 people looking on, the man was eventually apprehended and arrested.
