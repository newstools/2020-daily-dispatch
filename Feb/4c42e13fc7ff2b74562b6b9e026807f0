Businesses in the drought-stricken Butterworth have shut their doors after protesters blocked roads in the CBD on Tuesday morning. Protesters burnt tyres and blocked roads throughout the town. Schools have also closed. Mnquma local Municipality spokesperson Loyiso Mpalatshane said the protest was “over water related issues” in Butterworth. “Shops have closed because there was a widespread looting the last time we had a protest. The municipal building is open. Some people have showed up for duty.” DispatchLIVE spoke to a community leader Saziso Peter who said: “A statement will be released after a meeting” with community members. This is a developing story.
