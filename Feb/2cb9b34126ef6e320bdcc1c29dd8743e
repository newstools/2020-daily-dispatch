I read with sadness  that a young man’s life was tragically ended partly due to the condition of the road and surroundings on this stretch of coastal road (“Aphiwe Ngangana’s last ride on East Coast road of death”, Daily Dispatch, February 15). Why is it that deaths always have to occur before (any) urgent, lasting and proper repair and maintenance is done on our roads?    As South Africans we are taxed for so many things and in so many different areas, yet no  or very little maintenance is done on  Buffalo City Metro roads. Higher authorities need to urgently intervene and sort out negligence at BCM. Our city is fast becoming known of being  dirty and unkempt,  which  is bad for tourism.  This is unacceptable and needs rectifying with immediate effect! — Marius Sardinha, via e-mail
