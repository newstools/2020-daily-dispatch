A Nompumelelo informal settlement family of four were left destitute after their two-room shack burnt down to the ground on Friday morning. The shack owners, Khaya and Pumla Dyakophu, were not at  home when the fire started. Their children, Asive, 20, and 13-year-old Aluvuyo were also at school. The family's neighbours said they could smell something burning and saw the shack was on fire. Khaya told DispatchLIVE  attempts by neighbours to save furniture and clothing were in vain. Khaya said he left the house to go to a nearby clinic in Mooiplaas. Thirty minutes later he received a call that his house was on fire. Upon returning, there was nothing left of the shack. “What I am wearing is all I have. I lost everything including personal documents. “I am unemployed and don't know how I will rebuild the house,” he said. Neighbour Nkosikho Mlanjeni said it was about 10am when he heard a noise outside. He ran out to check and the fire had already engulfed her neighbour's shack.
