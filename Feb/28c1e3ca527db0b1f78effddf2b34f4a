Department of trade and industries (dti) deputy minister Fikile Majola was greeted by protesting students at Zwelitsha’s Lovedale TVET college on Friday. College students showed perfect timing to vent their dissatisfaction over several issues, only starting their protests, held outside the meeting hall, after Majola’s arrival. Student council president Eric Cuthu said they were not demanding anything — “it is not the way we do things” — but wanted Majola to hear their concerns. “We don’t have enough lecturers, we share one toilet, the premises are poor, the living conditions shocking, but most of all the NSFAS funds are not filtering through to students. “Our students don’t burn or break things, nor do we stop people going to lectures. “But we have had enough and want action.”
