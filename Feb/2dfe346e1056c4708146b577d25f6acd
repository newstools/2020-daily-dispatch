Twitter continues to have a field day after communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said during an interview that she and her husband had never been to Switzerland, only Geneva. Besides stating the obvious (that Geneva is in Switzerland), social media has been poking fun at the minister's error, with the city and country topping the Twitter trends list. Ndabeni-Abrahams was responding to a question by eNCA anchor Xoli Mngambi about whether she took her husband on an international trip to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Sunday Independent reported that Ndabeni-Abrahams allegedly abused state resources when she took her husband to Geneva, a claim she has denied. Ndabeni-Abrahams later apologised for the “error”, explaining she had meant to say France. “I profusely apologise for this error as I meant to say that we had not been in France in that particular instance, but in Geneva, where Mr Abrahams had accompanied me on an official trip, in line with the ministerial handbook.” But this didn't stop Twitter.
