Just a thought about the damage done by the Nahoon Parkrun: the event happens on a small section of one day once a week. There are people living in the bushes at Nahoon who do more damage every day, but no concern by the municipality there. We have sewage running freely into our ocean right on the Nahoon beach; seemingly no concern from BCM on that front either. It's not healthy at all to whoever walks on that beach as you literally have to walk through it. There's also a security risk to people who walk on the beach to get exercise or relax after a strenuous day at work, as many are getting accosted these days. It's just not safe to walk anywhere any more. The motivation of getting the park run to pay will not save the vegetation or the beach as the money will just go elsewhere. The park run is a group of caring people who help others to socialise by walking or running 5km once a week. It is for everyone. It is an enjoyable, relaxing, friendly group of people who offer the safety and pleasure of being able to walk freely and safely, doing something that's beneficial to all taking part. — Cheryl Bradford, via e-mail
