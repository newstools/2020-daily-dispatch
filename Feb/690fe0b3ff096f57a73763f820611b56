DA Federal Council Chairperson Helen Zille has vowed to leave Twitter, which she called an “evil platform” over what she called “the grotesque treatment of my grand-daughter on Twitter” after a series of insulting tweets on the social network yesterday. “I say goodbye to some of my followers, and good riddance to the haters, bots and sock-puppets that constitute such a large percentage of my 1,4-million plus followers ... Go well if you mean well. I'm out of here.” Zille said. Zille has in the past come under fire for her own Twitter comments, including a Tweet defending colonialism when she said: “For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water, etc. Would we have had a transition into specialised health care and medication without colonial influence? Just be honest, please.” DispatchLIVE
