Activist Mzwandile “Tswayi” Poswa died at Frere Hospital in East London last week. Spokesperson for the family and long-time friend Phakamisa Hobongwana said Poswa became an anti-apartheid activist in the 1980s at a time of extreme brutality by the security force   and political  suppression. He said Poswa kept activists’ morals high and was an articulate strategist and debater in struggle circles, especially in student politics. He was  detained without trial and served more than a year in St Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth. He was praised for his dynamic ability to manage crisis situations and for making the best call in tough times. He also displayed a wide knowledge and experience across a range of issues, and his interactions spanned generations. He had an ability to put people at ease. He had a large following of peace-loving people, the vulnerable, the needy and the poor, and he was in high demand as a programme director  at family  weddings, birthday parties and  funeral services. “He was indeed a pillar of strength and a shoulder to lean on,” said Upon his release from detention he returned to school where he completed his matric at Nombulelo High School in 1988. In 1989 he enrolled at the University of Fort Hare, at a time when student leaders had been expelled. He became active in the student movement when sport was involved in promoting the struggle. He was very active in coaching schoolboy rugby in Makhanda,  and played  in the Fort Hare University second division side in 1989. He also involved himself with the local  choirs such Abancedisi Choristers and Masakheke Youth Choir, where he demonstrated a huge talent as a bass vocalist. This was also where his provincial and national leadership skills were developed and honed. “Tswayi developed astuteness politically and became a smart leader who was to be a rare gem in his generation.” Poswa’s funeral service was held on Friday 9am at Nondlwana Methodist Church in Southern Africa, NU8, Mdantsane.
