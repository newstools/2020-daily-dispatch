Amavarara beat Super Eagles 2-1 during a toughly contested 2019/20 Nedbank Cup last 32 match at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday. The victory saw the Komani-based ABC Motsepe League side qualify to play in the last 16 teams stage on their first appearance in the lucrative cup competition, while their Free State-based opponents were eliminated from the competition. Two goals from former EC Bees midfielder Sihle Maso were enough to keep Amavarara in the running for the R7 million grand prize. mfundop@dispatch.co.za
