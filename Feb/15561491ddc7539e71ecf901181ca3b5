Finance minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday delivered his 2020 budget speech against the backdrop of a tough economy and an even tougher energy crisis. The biggest pinch will again be felt by motorists who will be hit by a double whammy: a fuel price levy and a Road Accident Fund levy. According to Susan Steward from Budget Insurance: “With the general fuel levy increasing by 16 cents per litre, cash-strapped motorists will have to make the most of every tank of fuel. Coupled with the 9 cents per litre RAF hike, you can expect to pay about R60 extra per month for a 60-litre tank of petrol if you fill up four times a month.” However, like Mboweni’s Aloe Ferox plant which “survives and thrives when times are tough” - there are ways to make the pinch less painful. “You can boost the fuel efficiency of your car by as much as 40% by maintaining your car and changing your bad driving habits,” says Steward. “So, if you fill up 48 times a year at about R1000 per tank, a 40% reduction in fuel consumption could save you over R19,000 a year.” Budget Insurance provides the following tips for better fuel economy: “Saving on fuel by keeping your car in shape and changing the way you drive may seem like a bit of a hassle, but if you increase your fuel economy by 40%, a tank that normally gets you 650km could get more than 900km. This translates to almost a tankful of savings for every two times you fill up,” concludes Steward.
