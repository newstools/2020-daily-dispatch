The National Council of SPCA (NSPCA) has enlisted the help of advocate Gerrie Nel and AfriForum in it's fight to stop the export  of live sheep from South Africa following the October 2019 shipment of 60,000 sheep from East London aboard the Al Shuwaikh. According to the NSPCA, another shipment of live ship is being prepared for transit in Berlin, outside East London, where they claim 70,000 live sheep are currently in a feedlot awaiting “imminent shipment”. The NSPCA has launched urgent application to the High Court to interdict the shipment. AfriForum’s CEO Kallie Kriel emphasised that the action was to stop the cruelty to the animals involved, not all animal trade. Senior inspector Grace De Lange, manager of the NSPCA’s farm animal protection unit, told DispatchLIVE: “We simply cannot allow the perpetuation and growth of this cruel and brutal trade.”
