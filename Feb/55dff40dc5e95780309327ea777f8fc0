Thank you for your article on the water quality in Mthatha ("Specialists Brought in to Improve Mthatha Water Quality", DD Feb 4) which was thought-provoking. The Mthatha dam was built during the Transkei homeland era, but we seem to still be out of danger when it comes to water availability, especially considering the vast area of coverage, which has been growing since the dam's establishment in the late 70s. But the following points seem to suggest that Mthatha is sitting on a ticking time bomb when it comes to governance and strategic water management as a whole: I wish the DD would monitor the water and refuse situation by dedicating a special team before it is too late. I also encourage the water authority to rethink its management of this scarce and precious resource. â€” Mzwandile Ferguson, via e-mail
