A  weeklong strike that saw  the Joan Harrison pool complex  closed to the public has  ended. Sources said the strike involved a pay issue and that lifeguards were involved, but BCM spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya said the details were a matter “between management and labour”. “The pool is open again,” Ngwenya said. Asked why there were ripped out  cupboards cluttering the entrance and  the men’s changing room, he said these were awaiting “disposal” in accordance with internal procedures. “The pool has been opened and staff are  working,” he said. “It is business as usual. We  would like to apologise to all those who were affected and inconvenienced during this period.” A visit to the complex on Tuesday  found that workers were cleaning the pools, and coach and activist Joe Hilstrom was back training his swimmers, one of them a 67-year-old woman who said she had started swimming from scratch, had lost 20kg and was ready to compete in the masters division.
