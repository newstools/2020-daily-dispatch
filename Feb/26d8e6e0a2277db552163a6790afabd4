Two Buffalo City Metro schools embarked on a total shutdown on Thursday over scholar transport delays at the schools. Parents and pupils of Gasela High School in Bulembu near King William’s Town and Embekweni Junior Primary School in Unit P, Mdantsane demonstrated outside their schools calling on the department of education to deliver on its promises. The schools said they have been sent “from pillar to post” by district officials. One parent Nomelikhaya Bangisa said Gasela High School pupils are “robbed of their lunch monies and cellphones by men who lurk in bushes in neighbouring villages.” She said pupils walk up to 35km to school and have to face different and “difficult” terrain to get to school. Embekweni junior school has been without electricity for two weeks. The school said the scholar transport issue was putting their pupils lives in danger. School principal  Pakamile Tyindyi had done everything in his power to fill out all required documents for the scholar transport programme. He said the school services 9 surrounding areas while 3 of those areas are without transport.
