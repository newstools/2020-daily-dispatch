There were numerous disruptions on Tuesday in the trial of five Mancoba Seven Angels Ministry members accused of killing five police officers in Ngcobo. Electricity interruptions and the unavailability of a stenographer delayed proceedings, before testimony finally got under way. Captain Vuyokazi Ngembe, the supply chain management head at Ngcobo police station, told the court that on the night of the killings, February 21 2018, service pistols were issued to six members — including three officers who were murdered. During the robbery of the police station, two shotguns and two R5 rifles were stolen. During the shoot-out with police, the gang took all six weapons that had been issued earlier, Ngembe said. Three pistols were taken from the dead officers. The remaining three were taken from the police who had been locked up in the back of a police van. Five members of the Seven Angels Church  are facing charges including murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit an offence, possession of firearms and defeating the ends of justice. The accused  are Andani Monco, 32, Kwanele Ndlwana, 24, Siphosomzi Tshefu, 26, Siphesihle Tatsi, 21, and Phumzile Mhlatywa, 48. The sixth accused, Phuthumile Mancoba, pleaded guilty last year and was fined R10,000 for defeating the ends of justice and illegally possessing firearms and ammunition. The trial continues. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
