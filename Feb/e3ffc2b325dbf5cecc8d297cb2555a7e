Hundreds of women protested outside the gates of parliament in Cape Town on Wednesday ahead of finance minister Tito Mboweniâ€™s annual budget speech. Representing various organisations, the women called for greater budget allowances for social grants and the fight against gender-based violence. They also wanted higher taxes on unhealthy food and beverages.
