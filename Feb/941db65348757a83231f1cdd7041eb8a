The ANC is a leader of society you cannot ignore even if you want to. It enjoys a huge following in the Eastern Cape. So when it elects its leadership, we have to be interested as part of the community. We must know who gets elected and why. The kind of a leader we elect will represent us for a predetermined period of time, and we must make sure we elect the right people from branch level to national. We must elect empathetic people who will lead with vision and care. Electing narcissistic leaders is disastrous as they do everything for themselves and no-one else. We must elect people who respect their positions, who will not see deployment as a chance to steal; people who have quality leadership traits whether they have poor backgrounds or not. Our parliament and local councils must not be a congress of Alibaba and his forty thieves, as Patrick Lumumba puts it. Leadership must never be bought by the highest bidders, people who see our government as their piggy bank. Elect people of high moral standing and support them with all you have. When your leaders go astray call them out. Never be afraid of the people you put in office. They are there for your needs. An elected iNjoli who eats our meat with his friends will never make it out of the kraal. The people's resources must be divided for the people by upright leaders who have only the interests of the people at heart. â€” Loyiso Mhloli, via e-mail
