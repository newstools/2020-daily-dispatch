A circuit breaker that tripped was responsible for many Â Gonubie residents being without power from Wednesday afternoon. Northern parts of the East London suburb were still without electricity on Thursday morning. This was confimed by Gonubie ward councillor Andre Swart. Traffic was heavily backed up near Kings Mall on Main Road due to non-functioning traffic lights just after 7am. Eslom announced that Stage 2 rotational load shedding would be implemented from 9am on Thursday until 6 am on Saturday.
