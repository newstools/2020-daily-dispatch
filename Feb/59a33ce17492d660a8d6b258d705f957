Three prisoners escaped from the Port Shepstone magistrate's court, south of Durban, on Monday. Police spokesperson Capt Nqobile Gwala said she was still gathering information about the incident. A source close to the investigation told TimesLIVE that the men escaped from court B. A KwaZulu-Natal department of correctional services official said the men had not yet been listed on their system and must have been under police guard at the time of their escape. It is unclear what charges the men are facing. Members of the public are urged not to approach the men if spotted, but to rather contact police on 10111. Last month, 15 awaiting-trial prisoners escaped while being taken to Westville prison after appearing in the Durban magistrate's court for various offences.
