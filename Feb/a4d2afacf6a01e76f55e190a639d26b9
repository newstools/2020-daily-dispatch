State electricity utility Eskom downgraded weekend load-shedding to stage 2 on Sunday morning, after initially saying stage 3 would continue until Monday morning. This was because four generating units "successfully returned to service" on Saturday night. On Saturday, Eskom said stage 3 rotational power cuts would be in place from 9am Saturday until 5am Monday. Despite some units returning to service on Friday night, stage 3 shedding was needed to “accommodate the shortage of capacity and to replenish emergency reserves”, said the statement. “Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10,612MW as at 6am this morning [Saturday], while planned maintenance is at 6,574MW. “As the system is vulnerable, any additional changes on the system performance may require a shift in stage at short notice.” * This story has been updated since it was first published on Saturday
