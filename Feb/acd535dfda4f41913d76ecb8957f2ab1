The article "Dubai to Pop up like Wonderland in Mpondoland" (DD Jan 31) refers. Our rural development & agrarian reform MEC, Nomakhosazana Meth, has plans to initiate projects yielding massive attractions for that rural area. This region and it's dear inhabitants first require their basic needs to be met before our leaders can attempt to imitate anything remotely similar to what Dubai offers. Dreams of such grandeur can only mean our MEC is on meth. — Cameron Armist, via e-mail ♦ When you get to be over 50, you tend to start thinking of memory loss and other age-related challenges. With this in mind it was with some shock that I read the article “Welcome to the New Dubai” (DD Jan 31). My first thoughts were, “oh my word, I must really be getting old — it’s the first of April and someone thought we were still in January”. This shock did not last long, but the realisation that it replaced it — that it was not an April fool’s joke and the article was serious — was much worse. I can only hope that common sense prevails and no more of that precious and limited resource, taxpayers' money, is not going to be wasted again on the Magwa Tea Estate. — Simon Kirk, via e-mail
