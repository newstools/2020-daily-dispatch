Philosopher Arrigo Sacchi defined football as the most important of the most unimportant things. As an ardent football connoisseur, I can relate to the inner pain “footy idleness” is causing but I fully support scrapping the local season. Let’s respect the sacrifices that our frontline heroes such as medical staff and security forces are making. Yes, we have heard talk of playing matches in empty stadiums, adhering to strict health guidelines, camping in hotels until the season is over and frequent testing. But do we have the resources? Have we thought about players or officials who are asymptomatic? Or that fan  without a TV who doesn’t miss a match at the tavern? With taverns closed, he will watch the game next door, risking infection. Having seen the likes of Belgium, Netherlands and France announcing a premature end to their regular seasons, there is something to ponder. Europe isn’t the world but it is in the richest corner. It drives the international football economy. No amount of money is greater than the value of human life. Those big match days that define us will be back.  Besides, what’s a game without a cold beer? — Farai Diza, Fourways
