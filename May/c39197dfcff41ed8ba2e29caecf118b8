For some time South Africa  has been adopting economic plans promising to grow the economy by not less than 6%. That target is yet to be achieved sustainably over at least a decade and many blame this on poor execution, but is that the only problem? We have been  shy to speak boldly about structural economic reforms, which still bear apartheid architecture. The ANC government has made strides to transform the economy, but  little has been achieved.  As a result  economic transformation  has become a dominant discourse as many South Africans are still excluded  from mainstream economy. Corruption, racism and incompetence have played a huge role in our economic woes.  Joblessness, poverty and hunger have become synonymous with many  households in SA. As we cast our eyes towards  the post  Covid-19 era, many opportunities must be pursued.  I propose some of the game changers which SA must focus on: Covid-19 presents us with a plethora of challenges, chief among them  the looming, unavoidable job losses,  contraction of the economy, the ever-increasing budget deficit and the shrinking Sars revenue. We therefore need  a new compact on rebalancing the structural defects in our economy; a strategy that would benefit everyone. SigqiboÂ  Mfuywa is a PhD candidate at Unisa.
