Buffalo City Metro on Wednesday night announced, via its Facebook page, that there would be an emergency power outage affecting large parts of East London from 11pm. The notice said that Vincent, Nahoon, Nahoon Valley, Dorchester Heights, Abbotsford, Chiselhurst and parts of Panmure would be without power. The widespread blackout is being implemented to allow the city's electrical technicians to make emergency repairs to the Chiselhurst substation. On Monday those areas were without power for much of the day after problems at the substation. BCM spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya said on Monday that technicians had been working on a fault caused by a “burnt isolator end, which is being replaced”.
