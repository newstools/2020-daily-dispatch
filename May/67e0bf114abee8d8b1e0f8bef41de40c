Former Miss SA hopeful Bianca Schoombee has spoken out since she withdrew her entry from the pageant after old racists tweets she posted as a 14-year-old resurfaced. Schoombee was also dropped by her modelling agency, SYNC, which had previously defended her, asking SA to forgive her.

Schoombee took to Instagram on Friday, detailing how God “knows us all by name and is praying for us, specifically that our faith will not fail”. She said that “we are made stronger to encourage and strengthen others”. You can read the full post here:
