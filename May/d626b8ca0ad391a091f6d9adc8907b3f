Fourie took the helm at the exchange about six months ago during an already tough time in the global economy. Economic headwinds for the exchange have  been amplified in 2020 by  the Covid-19 global pandemic and the ratings downgrade of South Africa’s sovereign debt to below investment grade.  We caught up with Fourie to discuss how these developments have affected capital raising and listings, and what her vision is for the exchange beyond Covid-19.
