With thousands of businesses being forced to close for the duration of the Covid-19 national lockdown South Africans are struggling with huge financial burdens, with many not being paid their full salaries or put on forced unpaid leave. The Covid-19 Temporary Employee / Employer Relief scheme (TERS) has been set up by government to give assistance by offering special payouts to people who have been affected. Workers are entitled to a maximum of R6,730 a month, with a minimum of R3,500, depending on their salaries. More than 100,000 payments to companies have already been paid by the scheme.
