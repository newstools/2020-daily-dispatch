A truck driver was arrested at a roadblock near Kei Bridge on Friday for allegedly trying to smuggle four people — three men and a woman — to East London. The four passengers were also taken into custody for contravening lockdown regulations. Their travel permits had  expired in mid-April. They had been hidden in the truck’s trailer, but when the vehicle reached the Kei Bridge checkpoint, they jumped off. DispatchLIVE understands the quartet then  managed to circumvent the checkpoint at Kei Bridge by walking through the bush to  the other side. Once the truck had been cleared at the checkpoint, the stowaways met it again down the road. However, this was seen by a passing motorist, who  alerted the police. The motorist, who wanted to remain anonymous but whose name is known to  DispatchLIVE, said he had been driving from Butterworth at about 9.30am when he noticed the “suspicious slow-moving truck” and the suspects coming out the bushes. “I suspected there was illegal movement of people the moment I saw the truck moving at the slow pace and the suspects coming out the bush and climbing onto the truck,” he said. “Within 500 metres I came across a police van and flagged it down. I pointed in the direction of the truck. Police rushed to the truck and that’s how they were arrested. The suspects tried to run away but they were circled. “Some of them produced permits for  attending a funeral but the permits had expired on April 18.” He said the driver did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the lockdown regulations. “We know people are being smuggled to other provinces, saying they are attending funerals," he said. "It is my view that each one of us has a responsibility to be vigilant and report these contraventions of the Disaster Management Act and to assist law enforcement agencies in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.” Comment from police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni had not been provided by the time of going to press.
