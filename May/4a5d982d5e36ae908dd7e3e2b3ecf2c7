From Monday June 1, liquor will be sold by licensed traders after a two-month ban on its sale under  lockdown regulations. Co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma announced last week that alcohol will be sold from Monday to Thursday between 9am and 5pm. Trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel said taverns, restaurants and shebeens are prohibited from allowing on-site consumption. This means people are only allowed to drink alcohol in their homes.
