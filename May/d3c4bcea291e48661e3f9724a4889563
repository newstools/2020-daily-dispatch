Court proceedings into the death of Alexandra resident Collins Khosa are under way in the high court on Tuesday. Khosa is said to have been gunned down in April by  soldiers deployed for the lockdown. Khosa's family have demanded financial compensation for loss of support, trauma, shock and psychological assistance. They are applying to the high court, citing several state entities and seeking the immediate dismissal of the  soldiers. Speaking on Radio 702 on Tuesday, attorney Wikus Steyl said the application was for protection and prevention of further abuse and misconduct by soldiers. “The situation has become so dire that we must approach the apex court, and that court must intervene in government decisions,” said Steyl. “If the soldiers who were involved in Mr Khosa’s killing are not disarmed and removed, who knows what they will do tonight or tomorrow? Another person can be killed in an instant.” Editor's Note: The original version of this story said that the matter was in the Constitutional Court, when it was in fact heard in the high court in Pretoria. The error is regretted.
