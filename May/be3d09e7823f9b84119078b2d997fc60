 Criminality  must be condemned  in the strongest of terms and the perpetrators  must  be punished severely. ‎The burglary and vandalism  at Vukuhambe Special School for  Learners with Physical Disabilities last month show the level of selfishness of some people within our communities. Poverty is no justification for committing criminal acts. It was to be expected during national lockdown that criminals would target soft spots  such as Vukuhambe to commit their nefarious activities. Police intelligence services should have known better and  acted accordingly. Since 2011 when I was an administrator at Vukuhambe, it has always been a target for  criminals. Invaluable  ‎resources  have been lost to criminals. To curb these repulsive deeds, the school safety & security subcommittee  was established.  It comprised of community members and Vulindlela police station. That structure must be  resuscitated, in order to protect the lives of these vulnerable children and employees,  and protect the invaluable equipment meant to rehabilitate the  pupils at the centre.  Vukuhambe was renovated  by the Eastern Cape department of education at a huge cost to  taxpayers.  Special schools located in suburbs are not burgled and this  justifies the need  to deploy  armed guards in the townships schools.  The vandals and lawbreakers must be stopped in their tracks. — Tandabantu T August‎, via e-mail
