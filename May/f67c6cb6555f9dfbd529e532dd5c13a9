Forget baking challenges and eating raw eggs, Springbok  rugby captain Siya Kolisi has challenged men to put their backs into it and clean the house. Kolisi has started a challenge for all men to pull their weight around the house instead of sitting back and relaxing while their partners do all the cooking and cleaning. On Tuesday, he shared a video of himself mopping a floor in his house on Instagram. He also said he would be giving away a prize to top contenders. “Starting a challenge for Men! Tag me in your house cleaning or cooking posts and you could win a signed rugby T-shirt,” said Kolisi. Here are four other times Kolisi has shared how he is spending his days during the Covid-19 lockdown.
