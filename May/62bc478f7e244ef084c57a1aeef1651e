Since the implementation of the lockdown on March 27, many people have lost their jobs and sources of income. Among those affected are hairdressers who are self-employed and owners of small informal businesses who solely depend on the money they receive from clients. LISTEN TO WHY SALON OWNERS WANT TO OPEN THEIR SALONS: With  beauty treatment services still  strictly prohibited,  they are  disadvantaged as their  businesses do not qualify for  unemployment insurance benefits. The Employers Organisation for Hairdressing Cosmetology and Beauty (EOHCB) put together a petition and got overwhelming support from the industry and clients to reopen salons. Their efforts, however, did not persuade  the government to ease  the restrictions. However,  it seems  there might be light at the end of a tunnel  after a live video on Facebook  went viral in which Jade Delphine Tomé, a South African hair industry entrepreneur living in Portugal,  advocated for  the reopening of hair salons in SA under strict regulations. Tomé's quest has led to advocate Carlo Viljoen and  associates at Victor Online Legal Consultancy joining her and  applying for an urgent court interdict  allowing the industry to reopen, arguing that it has put a financial strain  on many hairdressers.
