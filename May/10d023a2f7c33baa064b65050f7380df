A 32-year-old man, accused of being a “social media rapist” has been arrested by Komani police and stands accused of being a serial rapist who preyed on his young victims by using fake Facebook accounts. Police say the man used the fake profiles to lure women under the guise as being a photographer offering modelling jobs. The suspect was apprehended after a case of rape was opened by a 17-year-old girl who said he had raped her after a photo shoot. Further investigation revealed that the man had been travelling the country and advertising on numerous Facebook accounts to groom young girls and lure them for photography sessions. Once establishing the suspects true identity several other pending rape cases against him came to light. Police believe that there may be several more rapes not yet attributed to the suspect because of his modus operandi and the fake identities he used on Facebook.
