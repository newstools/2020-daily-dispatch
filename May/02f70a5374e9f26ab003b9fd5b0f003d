Eastern Cape artists paid tribute to the late prominent gospel sensation Malibongwe Gcwabe who passed away last week with a live show broadcast via social media. The one of the kind online tribute played out at the Guild Theatre in honour of Gcwabe, a best gospel artist SABC Crown Gospel Award nominee who had a career that spanned 25 years. Gcwabe, 55, popularly known for hits such as Iyo Calvary and Uyehova Ulungile died last week at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in East London. The tribute was organised by Buffalo City Performing Arts Council (BCPAC). Lusizo Khango opened the show shortly after 3pm with a live band. However, technical glitches stood in the way of progress. Chairperson Luzuko Khohli described Gcwabe as a significant member of the council, a God-fearing man who valued prayer and a tenacious man who served God's people. He said Gcwabe granted opportunities for his vocalists to develop themselves as singers. “We will miss him for love for people, his sound and giving a platform to upcoming talent,” he said. Gcwabe released his latest song, Rise Up From Corona featuring gospel star Khanyisa Nkantsu inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic gripping countries worldwide. The song motivates people to not give up the fight against the virus. Some of the artists who payed tribute included Betusile Mcinga and Yolanda Vuthela.
