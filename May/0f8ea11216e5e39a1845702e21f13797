Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth Sandton chose JSE as his stock pick of the day and Nick Crail from Ashburton Investments chose Standard Bank in the short term. Reeders said: “My pick is JSE shares, I said I was looking at companies that might actually benefit from this lot and the price was lacklustre beforehand but things have changed.” Crail said: “Well, first and foremost on my radar screen is cash at the moment, but I think if I were to take a three-year time frame once we’ve recovered and I think the most value at the moment is probably sitting in the financial stocks, in the banks. I prefer Standard Bank at the moment.”
