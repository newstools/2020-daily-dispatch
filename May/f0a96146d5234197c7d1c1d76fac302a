In an about turn, Buffalo City Metro has vowed to restore power to five suburbs affected by the widespread electrical outage on Monday. The affected suburbs are Vincent, Abbotsford, Nahoon, Baysville and Bonnie Doon. Earlier, the BCM spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya had said the blackout would continue through the night and be resolved on Tuesday. "Our technicians are onsite working on the fault following a burnt isolator end, which is being replaced. Consumers are advised to switch off plugs and appliances. We apologize for the inconvenience," said Ngwenya in a statement. The metro could not confirm what time power would be restored on Monday night.
