Fishermen in Sierra Leone on Wednesday attacked a police station and a health clinic in an angry response to drastic cuts in the number of boats allowed to go to sea as part of measures to fight Covid-19, local officials said. After three days of strict isolation, economic activity was authorised anew on Wednesday morning in the poor West African nation, but fishermen in the major port of Tombo were informed on shore that no more than 15 out of hundreds of vessels could sail. The restriction, which was not previously announced, was taken out of “fear that there would be too many people at the wharf” when boats returned to the port, said Kashor Holland Cole, chairman of the district collective including Tombo, about 50 kilometres south of Freetown. Authorities also acted out of concern that people from neighbouring Guinea would be brought in by boat, despite closed borders, he added. “Just after the announcement at the wharf the fishermen and some youths went on the rampage, destroying the police station, a community clinic and the house of the Tombo community chief,” a senior police source said, asking not to be named. The authorities restored a daytime curfew with the military to restore calm. Dozens were arrested and taken to a police station for further investigation, the police source said, adding details of any casualties were unknown The government released a statement saying that “certain individuals and communities began targeting ambulances and healthcare workers in the course of providing essential healthcare services.” The country has so far recorded 225 coronavirus cases, 14 of them fatal. During the Ebola epidemic that ravaged west Africa in 2014-2016, at a cost of some 4,000 lives in Sierra Leone, many inhabitants strongly opposed tests for the virus and attacked medical workers trying to combat the disease.
