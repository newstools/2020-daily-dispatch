President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that any sanctions imposed by the European Union on Turkey will not have a great affect, adding that the bloc had never acted honestly or kept its promises. Ahead of an EU summit on Thursday, Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara that “honest leaders” within the EU were against sanctions on Turkey and that Ankara would continue to defend its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. President Tayyip Erdogan criticised on Wednesday US says and actions in response to Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defence systems, which could trigger US sanctions on Ankara. Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Erdogan also said he would talk to President-elect Joe Biden, who has criticised the Turkish president, once Biden takes office next month.
