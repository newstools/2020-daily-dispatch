Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is  to appear in court next month â€” as an accused. According to documents TimesLIVE obtained on Tuesday, Mkhwebane will appear in the Pretoria magistrate's court on January 21 on three counts of perjury. A summons ordering her to appear in court is dated Tuesday December 15. The charge stems from a perjury complaint against her laid by Accountability Now director Paul Hoffman in August last year. In an affidavit Hoffman submitted to the police, he reportedly said the criminal charge arose from a Constitutional Court judgment that found Mkhwebane was dishonest in her conduct in the case surrounding the investigation into the apartheid-era loan by the SA Reserve Bank to Bankorp, which is now part of Absa. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
