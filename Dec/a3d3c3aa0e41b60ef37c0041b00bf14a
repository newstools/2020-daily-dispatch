The ANC has paid tribute to former South African ambassador to Uganda and journalist Jon Qwelane who died this week. Qwelane was appointed ambassador to Uganda in 2010. "He served his country with distinction and unwavering commitment," said ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe. "Qwelane was a fearless and prolific journalist and talkshow host who pushed the envelope and influenced public discourse. The ANC sends its heartfelt condolences to the Qwelane family, friends and the diplomatic community. We wish them strength and comfort during their moment of grief." Qwelane was at the centre of controversy at some stage after his column on same-sex marriage sparked outrage. DispatchLIVE
