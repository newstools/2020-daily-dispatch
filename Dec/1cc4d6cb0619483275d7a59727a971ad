The double SA title fight tournament was scheduled to be held in East London on Saturday has been postponed. This was revealed by tournament organisers Xaba Promotions. The show was to be held at East London International Convention Centre. The tournament becomes the second to be pulled off in a space of a week after Rumble Africa Promotions show which was initially scheduled to be held at Orient Theatre, just less than a kilometre from ICC, was also shelved. Both tournaments were shelved due to what organisers attributed to the resurgence of Covid-19 infections in the Buffalo City Metropolitan area. XP boss Ayanda Matiti said the tournament which was to be televised by SuperSport would be rescheduled for a date yet to be confirmed in 2021. “It is with heavy heart that we are forced to reschedule the tournament owing to the spike in Covid19 infections in the BCM area,” XP said in a statement. The tournament was to feature two SA title bouts with Ntlantla Tyirha defending his junior flyweight crown against Nwabisile Cholani while Asanda Gingqi was to face late substitute Toto Helebe for the vacant featherweight diadem.
