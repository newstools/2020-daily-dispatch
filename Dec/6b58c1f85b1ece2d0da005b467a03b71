South Africans have been warned against flocking to the country’s dams and rivers as an alternative to the beaches after a government ban on the use of some of beaches to minimise the transmission of Covid-19. This week President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the government’s decision to bar public access to Eastern Cape beaches between December 16 2020 and January 3  2021. Spokesperson of the department of water & sanitation, Sputnik Ratau, said access to Durban beaches is also prohibited on busy public holidays until the first week of January next year. Ratau also expressed concern that the festive season could see a spike in drownings. “Drowning is serious and poses a public health threat. According to Stats SA, fatal drowning is the fifth leading cause of unintentional death in the country. The department therefore urges parents to always accompany their children to ensure their safety when they go swimming,” he said.
