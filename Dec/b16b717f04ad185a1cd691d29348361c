In an apparent case of mistaken identity, a young traditional healer was allegedly abducted in Butterworth on Monday morning. Mzwamadoda Feni, 26, from Ngcobo, was  visiting one of his clients when he was allegedly kidnapped by two men at Skiti township in Butterworth. According to Feni's sister Nosiphelo, revenge was believed to be behind the attack as one of the men reportedly claimed that Feni had previously shot him. “The client, who attends the same church as my brother's ex-wife, witnessed the incident. The men allegedly bludgeoned and stabbed my brother so badly to such an extent that he could not breathe properly before they sped off with him in a Toyota Tazz,” said Nosiphelo. “We are only hoping that he is still alive,” said Nosiphelo. Feni's family said police were investigating the matter. Attempts are being made to get comment from the police. DispatchLIVE
