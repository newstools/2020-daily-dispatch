Proteas seamer Kagiso Rabada has been medically cleared to be part of the squad for the New Yearâ€™s Test against Sri Lanka at the Wanderers. Rabada missed the  first Test match in Centurion because of a right adductor muscle strain injury which saw him ruled out of the ODI series against England in Cape Town last month. The 25-year-old has successfully gone through all the Covid-19 and pre-Bio-Secure Environment (BSE) entry protocols and is expected to enter the BSE before the start of the second session on Monday.
