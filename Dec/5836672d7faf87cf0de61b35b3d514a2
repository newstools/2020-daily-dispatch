Earlier today Buffalo City Metro (BCM) launched its festive safety campaign aimed at ensuring minimal carnage on the roads during the festive season. The metro says it expects residents and visitors to respect the rules of the road. It also warned taxi drivers and other commuter vehicles to respect Covid-19 protocols so that we can have a safer city. BCM said it would not hesitate to impound cows on our roads #ACityHardAtWork
