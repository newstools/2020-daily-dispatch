Trauma cases at Eastern Cape hospitals escalated sharply between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day. This is despite Covid-19 presenting a massive threat to South Africans over the festive period and restrictions on alcohol sales and beaches being in place. At Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital on December 24, there were 18 cases. But on Christmas Day there were 40 cases at the same hospital – 30 of which were stabbings. Sixteen trauma patients were admitted to East London’s Frere Hospital between 7am and 7pm on Christmas Day, but between 7pm on December 25 and 7am on December 26, a further 39 trauma patients had been admitted. Eastern Cape health department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said: “We are still appealing to the public to take Covid-19 seriously and stop its spread. “We remain of the view that it will be won in the communities not in hospitals. We have noted with grave concern and disappointment that our hospitals still have to deal with alcohol related trauma cases.” DispatchLIVE
