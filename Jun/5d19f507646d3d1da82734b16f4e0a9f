I fully support premier Oscar Mabuyane’s call for the reintroduction of strict measures on the sale of alcohol (‘Call for New EC booze ban’, DD, June 9). In our “new normal” where the country is under siege by the Covid-19 pandemic, we can’t afford to have alcohol-induced traumas adding more pressure to our health care system. Multitudes of people are ill or dying and we need to take a stand to support pronouncements by the premier. It does not help that people think they are drowning their sorrows when they drink alcohol because what they are in fact doing is drowning reality. It results in us failing to lead our children to a brighter future as money is spent on alcohol. Booze is blocking many families from breaking the cycle of poverty. Premier, go ahead and ask for a booze ban. Thousands of people in the province will support your call and initiatives. The “new normal” must bring about an orderly society. Ban booze for our own good. — Andile Magwaca, Mdantsane
