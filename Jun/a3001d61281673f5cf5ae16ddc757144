Buffalo City had its hands full as fires wreaked havoc across the metro on Thursday. One of the fires was burning alongside the North East Expressway in East London. "We have a team going onsite to deal with the NEX fire. As with most fires, we suspect that the weather conditions plus human carelessness might be responsible," BCM spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya told DispatchLive onThursday evening. "We have been dealing with a lot of fires more particularly today (Thursday) across the municipality. We have had 36 fires reported today with our vehicles and officers all over the city putting them out.â€‹" "With the dry winter season with cold strong winds, we expect these type of incidents to occur more than normal. We ask people to contact us as soon as they see any veld fires so that we can combat the fire before serious damages occur." Ngwenya warned people not to start fires or throw burning things on dry vegetation.
