The board of Metair, the manufacturer, distributor and retailer of batteries and automotive components, has approved a R900m capital investment programme as it gears up to benefit from a number of new vehicle types entering production in South Africa. The group has secured key contracts over the next two to three years — notably contracts with Ford, which has invested heavily in SA recently. Metair will construct a new manufacturing facility in Stanger, KwaZulu-Natal, and a new logistics facility in Silverton, Gauteng. The board’s approval of the R900m capital investment, including major investments in greenfield facilities, will create about 3,300 jobs. Even before Covid-19 hit, vehicle production volumes for 2020 were forecast to be static or slightly down, but the group is optimistic about the next three years, having secured contracts with Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Volkswagen and Isuzu. A number of other subsidiaries will support Ford, including Unitrade, Automould and Lumotech, supplying a variety of wires, plastic and chrome-plated parts, as well as headlights and tail lights. “Securing Ford as a major customer is a critical step in ensuring the long-term growth and sustainability of the automotive components business,” the group said. “The board remains cognisant of the company’s solvency and liquidity ratios in the current operating environment and will closely monitor and review actual capital commitment and optimal timing requirements.”  — BDlive
