Samwu in King Sabata Dalindyebo municipality is mourning the death of another union leader. Amos Mbotoli died on Monday struggling to breathe. He was the union's regional deputy chair, with 25 years experience at KSD. Just days earlier, shop steward Andile Mkosi succumbed to Covid-19 after being admitted to the Mthatha General Hospital on Saturday. Samwu chair Lwazi Madyibi was numb with shock at the sudden passing of two of its “tried and tested” leaders. Both had stood unflinchingly against injustices within the municipality, he said. “They withstood vicious attacks, sometimes from within our own ranks. They remained committed to the union, even at the worst of times, until the end.” Mkosi served as a public safety shop steward and Mbotoli as an infrastructure shop steward. “He [Mbotoli] served the union in different capacities from local to provincial level. He has served as branch chair, regional gender co-ordinator and provincial gender committee member.” Madyibi said all Samwu KSD members could attest to the commitment displayed by the two leaders in the fight for better working conditions. “We are deeply hurt by the loss and send our heartfelt condolences to their families, friends, colleagues and comrades in the union.” KSD municipal spokesperson Sonwabo Mampoza said management had conveyed condolences to the Mbotoli family. He described him as a responsible employee who, despite his union activities, still found time to do his work with aplomb. Mbotoli had earned the respect of everyone in KSD due to his work ethic. “The family's loss is also our loss. He was mature during negotiations with management,” Mampoza said.
