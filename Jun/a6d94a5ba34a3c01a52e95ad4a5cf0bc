Buffalo City Metro mayor Xola Pakati on Friday morning announced that he had tested negative for Covid-19. Pakati was tested on Tuesday  as a precaution after a  BCM councillor  tested positive the previous week. Pakati wished the Covid-19 positive councillor well in fighting the coronavirus. “While my Covid-19 test results are a great relief, I hope that the entire situation will serve as a lesson to the people of the city to always be vigilant,” he said. Pakati said he would “unpack the progress made thus far and what is still to be done” in the battle against Covid-19 when he delivers the state of the city address next week. “We will beat this virus together,” he said.
