Education activists and some schools are taking basic education minister Angie Motshekga to court after she “backtracked” on a promise to reinstate the National Schools Nutrition Programme (NSNP) to feed nine million pupils from this month, irrespective of whether or not they are back at school. SA’s health-care system faces a total medical needs onslaught as it races towards the Covid-19 surge. We drill down on how the fight is bedevilled by PPE, bed and test problems, and meddling unions. SA's Covid-19 death toll has climbed to 1,480 with a massive increase in new cases recorded, health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Sunday evening. The country has recorded a further 57 Covid-19 related deaths: 42 in the Western Cape, 10 in the Eastern Cape and five in KwaZulu-Natal. SA has tested one million people for Covid-19 - and that's no mean feat. But we can only hope the far simpler antibody tests become more reliable. A number of schools across the country have been forced to close after teachers or people in contact with the schools tested positive for Covid-19. Some of the cases were confirmed last week, preventing schools from opening on Monday June 8, while others were confirmed earlier this week.
