Hundreds of people parked their vehicles on the side of the road and began throwing snowballs, making snowmen and running in the soft, scrunchy snow at Matroosberg Nature Reserve, outside Ceres, on Thursday. Inches-deep snow covered the high-lying areas of the Western Cape after an icy cold front began rolling in on Tuesday. TimesLIVE went to speak with the people enjoying the snow.
