In a shocking turn of events, the home of slain Mdantsane football boss and traditional healer Siphiwo "Mawawa" Nyobo was petrol bombed and burnt to the ground in the early hours of Saturday morning. Nyobo, who owned the popular Mdantsane-based ABC Motsepe League club Tornado FC, was gunned down outside North End Stadium in East London on March 2 2019. A rondavel, which the family used for traditional healing purposes at NU17, was also burnt down. Nyobo's daughter, Yanga Nyobo, expressed shock and devastation. Yanga said it was believed that whoever killed her father was also behind the latest incident. She told DispatchLIVE that the incident reopened old wounds as it was not the first attack directed at the family. "They killed my father and now they want to kill his legacy. This thing is getting serious now," she said. Neighbours described Nyobo as a pillar of the Mdantsane community. They said he was highly regarded in the area and had helped young people interested in soccer to realise their dreams.Vulindlela Ndawonye, a local resident, said the whole community was in shock and disturbed by the incident. "He left a legacy for his children and someone is trying to destroy all that. People think this happened because of jealousy," said Ndawonye. Police had not released a statement at the time of publishing.
