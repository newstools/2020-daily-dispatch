A resident from the Lily Kirchmann Complex at Berea Gardens Retirement Centre in Berea, East London, has tested positive for Covid-19. The resident, whose name has been withheld to protect their privacy, tested positive following their admission to St Dominics Hospital for a lung infection. Berea Gardens Retirement Foundation executive manager Mike Schulze said: “it seems likely that he contracted it from a care worker in the step-down unit who developed symptoms of the coronavirus after her day shift. “She had been asymptomatic up to that point and had passed the daily screening prior to her shift commencing. “She was advised to stay off work and seek medical attention immediately, which she did and was hospitalised on Wednesday June 3. She has been confirmed as Covid-19 positive,” he said. Schulze said the remaining residents in the step-down unit had been placed under quarantine and the area had been sanitised. At the time of writing, no other residents in the unit have shown Covid-19 symptoms. “There was only one patient in the unit who had been discharged within the window period of infection. She has been contacted and has had self-isolation procedures explained to her,” said Schulze. The step-down unit is staffed separately from the rest of the Lily Kirchmann complex and no interaction has been allowed between the two. -  GO!&Express
