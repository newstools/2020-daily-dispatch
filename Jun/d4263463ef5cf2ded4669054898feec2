When Metrorail trains are allowed to operate again on Wednesday, the Eastern Cape will be running a reduced service as determined by level 2 lockdown regulations in East London and Port Elizabeth. Trains would operate between  5.15am and 7.30pm, Prasa spokesperson Mimi Katsio said on Tuesday. Commuters were advised to consider other transport modes as limited tickets would be sold. Services will be phased in gradually with stops only at key stations. Less used stations will not re-open initially. In East London, the train will stop at Berlin, Fort Jackson, Mt Ruth, Edgerton, Mdantsane, Mtsotso, Vincent, Southernwood and East London."Physical distance must be maintained outside the station, inside the station, on the platforms and in the trains as indicated by markers," Katsio said. Only four stops will be allowed in Port Elizabeth stations - Uitenhage, Swartkops, North End and Port Elizabeth. Prasa has the following interventions in place to lower infection risk: *    Physical distance markers (stations, ticket sale points, platforms, inside the trains) *    Customer services, security & marshals (for crowd control) *   Passenger advice and information (print, audio)For commuters the rule is simple - no mask, no entry. "Marshalls will monitor compliance on platforms and no eating or drinking is allowed. Informal trading is also prohibited," Katsio said.
