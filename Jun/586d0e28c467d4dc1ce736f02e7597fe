Three soldiers have been charged with murder over a massacre in western Cameroon, where security forces are fighting anglophone separatists, the army said on Thursday. "The three Cameroonian soldiers have been placed in provisional detention in Yaounde military prison," said army spokesman Colonel Cyrille Atonfack Guemo, adding that they had been charged with "murder". At least 10 children and three women were killed on February 14 in the village of Ngarbuh, according to the authorities. The military initially denied any killings and said the deaths had resulted from an "unfortunate accident" which happened when fuel containers exploded in crossfire between separatists and troops. The UN said at least 23 civilians died. As the international outcrcy amplified, President Paul Biya ordered an investigation. The preliminary conclusions, published in mid-April, found that three "uncontrolled" soldiers who had disobeyed orders killed 10 children and three women with the help of local auxiliaries from the Fulani, or Peul, ethnic group. The troops then "tried to hide the facts by setting fires" before submitting a bogus report, according to the probe. The massacre took place in the Northwest Region, which with the neighbouring Southwest Region was once part of British colonies in West Africa. They joined French-speaking Cameroon after it gained independence from France in 1960. Decades of grievances at perceived discrimination by the francophone majority brewed into a declaration of independence in October 2017, which was followed by a government crackdown. The declaration has not been recognised internationally and Biya has refused demands to return to a federal system. The violence has claimed more than 3,000 lives and and at least 700,000 have fled their homes. Rights monitors say abuses have been committed by both sides. — AFP
