The cabinet says it is studying the high court ruling which found that while the establishment of the state of disaster to handle the Covid-19 pandemic was in itself valid, several of the regulations promulgated under the lockdown levels infringed on individual rights and were invalid. The lockdown regulations will remain in place for the next two weeks, as Judge Norman Davis gave the government time to “review, amend and republish regulations” to ensure they were consistent with the constitution. Judge Norman Davis on Tuesday issued a scathing assessment of the government's lockdown laws, saying they weren't well thought out and went against the Bill of Rights. While Davis said the establishment of the lockdown itself under the Disaster Management Act was legal, he was critical of the individual regulations, saying that they did not pass the test for rationality. In fact, he said, they were "unconstitutional". Here - in Davis' own, unedited words - are specific examples of the "irrational" rules cited in the judgment: Online orders for one Johannesburg-based liquor store have been booming since the lifting of the ban on alcohol during the nationwide lockdown. On Monday, licensed liquor venues reopened to sell alcohol, two months after the ban was put in place at the end of March. Liquor stores are allowed to operate only from Monday to Thursday between 9am and 5pm. E-commerce deliveries (but not orders) are subject to the same days and times. Since the lifting of the ban, thirsty South Africans have wasted no time in placing their booze orders online for delivery. The Eastern Cape government plans to transform the old Mthatha Airport hangers, Buffalo City Stadium and other state properties into isolation and quarantine sites. The province is bracing itself for the Covid-19 pandemic’s peak​ in September.
