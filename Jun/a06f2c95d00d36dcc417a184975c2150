Wealth and asset manager Peregrine Holdings says SA is still a long way from returning to normal after the Covid-19 pandemic, and volatility should persist for the next six to 12 months. The  economic and social impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown are starting to come to the fore, and South Africa’s ability to respond to the crisis remains limited by an economy that was under strain before the pandemic hit, the group said on Tuesday. “Whilst uncertainty prevails as to how this crisis will play out to finality, we are still a long way from returning to normal,” the group said. “Fiscally, before the Covid-19 crisis SA was in a difficult situation, so the ability to create space for stimulus remains highly limited as business confidence has slumped to an all-time low,” it said.
