Hudson Park High School is the latest East London school to close after an educator at the school tested positive for Covid-19. In a letter sent out on late on Thursday, Headmaster Dennis Vorster said that the school would be closed until Tuesday to allow for a "complete sanitisingÂ  process" and that school would resume on Wednesday. Vorster asked that parents recognise the gravity of the situation while he assured them that the school would do all in its power to ensure the safety of staff and pupils.
