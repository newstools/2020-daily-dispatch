Yet another Eastern Cape pupil has tested positive for Covid-19. Port Alfred High School became the latest school to record a case of Covid-19. The school will be closed for a week for decontamination. “This letter serves to inform you that one of our learners in the Intermediate Phase has tested positive for Covid-19. As per the Department of Education guidelines, Port Alfred High School will be closed from Monday, 29 June to allow time to conduct a complete sanitising process and review other possible infections,” said deputy headmaster Dr I Knott-Craig in a letter to pupils, parents and teachers. “At this stage, it is anticipated that the school will reopen on Friday, 3 July, but further communication will be made early next week with updated information and confirmation. “All staff and learners who may be at risk will be contacted and informed. Now is the time to support those who have been affected, to afford them the strength and space to fully recover.” Knott-Craig , who is also the school's chair of the health and safety committee, appealed to all parties involved to recognise the gravity of the situation. “Our school will continue to do everything possible to ensure the continued wellbeing of our community,” Knott-Craig.
