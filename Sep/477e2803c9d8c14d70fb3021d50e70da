Suspected vandals who allegedly targeted Buffalo Flats astro turf in East London have been exposed after a motorist captured them on camera, carrying what appears to be sections of the missing turf rolled up. The video shows the suspects after they were spotted by the motorist who was driving past. The suspects try to hide their faces as a woman in the car makes it clear that  she is determined to show their faces in the video. The facility belongs to Buffalo City Metro, “This is an astro turf in Buffalo Flats. This has been an ongoing issue including the vandalism of changing rooms and ablution facilities,” metro spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya told DispatchLIVE on Tuesday afternoon. The metro, according to Ngwenya, do not currently have security onsite. The metro  has opened several cases with the police regarding the ongoing vandalism. “There have been unconfirmed claims that the community wants the turf to be converted into a soccer field, hence the  vandalism. But by vandalising a government property in this fashion the community is letting itself down and depriving youngsters of access to such a facility,” Ngwenya added. There has been no comment from police at the time of publication. DispatchLIVE
