The man accused of killing nine-year-old Aqhama Tom will make his first court appearance at the Hankey​ Magistrates Court on a charge of murder on Thursday. According to police spokesperson Majola Nkohli, police arrested the 40-year-old man, who murdered Aqhama “within six hours after she was reported missing” in Hankey on Monday at about 2pm. Nkohli said Aqhama was last seen on Sunday at about 4pm in Matodlana Street in Weston in Hankey. The following evening police investigators arrested the man for Aqhama's murder. “The suspect led the police to the bushes near route R330 in Hankey, where he pointed out the body of Aqhama Tom,” said Nkohli. Acting Sarah Baartman District Commissioner, Brigadier John Lebok said: “It is unbelievable that in our attempts to end the attacks against women and children, some people are not heeding our calls.” “The death of anyone is painful, but losing someone under such circumstances is very sad, and painful, but I hope the deceased family will find solace in knowing that the suspect is behind bars.”
