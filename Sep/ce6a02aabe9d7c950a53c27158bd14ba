As we celebrate Heritage Month and bow our heads in salute of our forbearers, no less a figure than Nkosi Jongumsobomvu Maqoma is more deserving of our remembrance. September 9   marked 152 years since the death  the  hero best known for the courageous battles he fought  between 1850-1853 against the British colonialists. The Eastern Cape is  known as the home of the legends and certainly Maqoma’s name should be  top  on  that list. Maqoma’s remains were exhumed from an unmarked grave on Robben Island in 1978 reburied at Ntabaka Ndoda. As the call to rename places around the country gathers momentum,  the Nkosi Jongumsobomvu Foundation has called for Fort Beaufort to be renamed after the heroic warrior, Maqoma. We also endorse renaming of the East London Airport to  King Phalo. — Vuyo Fani is  CEO of the Nkosi Jongumsobomvu Foundation.
