The Eastern Cape government appointed  Nomawethu Ngcakani as   secretary of the Bhisho legislature this week, making her only the second woman in South Africa to serve as a secretary in parliament. She takes over from Vuyani Mapolisa, whose contract ended earlier this year. Born in Mdantsane, Ngcakani, 50, holds a BCom degree from the University of Fort Hare. In 2006 she became the first woman to hold the position of CFO in the office of the premier. An ordained bishop with the Burning Bush Ministries in East London, she told the Dispatch this week that more woman needed to be appointed in leadership positions. “This is a huge milestone for women and also for the legislature. As the first female appointment for this position in the province we can celebrate it but we are still far behind in changing things around for women.” The mother of three attributed her success to her family. “My background is my motivation. My parents had very little and were not educated but they worked hard to make sure we were educated. I believe we can add value to our society if we  pursue a culture of uplifting each other in our families,” she said. “I have a husband and family who support me in the sacrifices I have to make. I have confidence in the work of the legislature and the team that is already here. I should be able to drive the legislature in terms of the strategic vision for this term.” Legislature speaker Helen Sauls-August described Ngcakani as the ideal candidate for the position. “We are  happy  the process was  open for unions to observe through the whole shortlisting and interview process,” she added. “Ngcakani is not new to the legislature or the province — she has a wealth of experience and we believe she can take this legislature forward. There is huge expectation and it will test her maturity on how she deals with all the issues that are put at her door. “She must be the driver and voice of reason.” — DispatchLIVE
