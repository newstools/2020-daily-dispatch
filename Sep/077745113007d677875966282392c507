Controversial funeral painter Lebani “Rasta” Sirenje has again sparked anger and calls for someone to take away his brushes, after unveiling a portrait of late human rights advocate George Bizos.

A funeral service was held for the activist on Thursday at the Hellenic Cultural Centre in Johannesburg. As friends and admirers flooded social media with messages of condolences and tributes, Rasta posted a portrait he had done of Bizos.

Some said Morgan Freeman, others joked it looked like a “dark skinned Albert Einstein!". Musician Lvovo weighed in, saying it looked like apartheid struggle icon Walter Sisulu.
