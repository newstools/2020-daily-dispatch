Eastern Cape health MEC Sindiswa Gomba has vowed to leave no stone unturned after her department launched a probe when more burnt Komani Hospital linen and clothes were found dumped in Cathcart on Tuesday night. This just days after linen and clothes were first found illegally dumped in Mlungisi township in Komani at the weekend. Provincial health department Sizwe Kupelo said that, in that instance, it was established that the linen and clothes were from a laundromat tender awarded to a service provider whose contract had ended last year. The provincial health department has now launched an investigation into how Komani Hospital linen and clothes were dumped and burnt in Cathcart. Kupelo said that Gomba had sent a team led by the security director to the hospital linen and clothes that were found burning of the side of the N6 road in Cathcart on Tuesday night and it was established that the hospital linen and clothes were from the Komani Hospital. “We cannot have a situation where hospital linen and clothes are dumped or burnt because that means we are taking one step forward and two backwards as we have to constantly buy linen we already bought,” said Gomba. “This is unacceptable and all those found to be in the wrong will face the music. For now we cannot pre-empt what will happen but if our staff is involved in this shameless act, our human resources processes will kick in,” she said, condemning the burning of the items. The department will release the findings of the investigation once it has been completed. DispatchLIVE
