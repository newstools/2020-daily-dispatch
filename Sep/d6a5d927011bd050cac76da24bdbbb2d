A Butterworth man who allegedly beat his girlfriend to death with an extension cord in “a  rage of jealousy” will appear in the local magistrate's court on Tuesday. The 42-year-old man was arrested on Sunday for the murder of his 26-year-old girlfriend at Bawa village in Butterworth. Police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni confirmed the​ arrest. “It is alleged that the suspect assaulted the 26-year-old woman on Sunday at about 7pm at Lalini Locality, Bawa Village, Butterworth,” he said. According to Tonjeni, the suspect believed that the woman was dating another man in the same village. “The suspect is alleged to have used an extension cord to assault the victim until she died at his house. The deceased was identified as Siphosethu Qoqa,” Tonjeni said. The young woman's murder comes merely a month after Asithandile 'Kwasa'Zozo from Dutywa, about 35km from Butterworth, was stabbed to death by his ex-boyfriend Viwe Rulumeni. Rulumeni will be back in the dock on October 6. Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Liziwe Ntshinga condemned the brutal murder of the “defenceless woman” and congratulated Butterworth police for swift response in arresting the suspect.
