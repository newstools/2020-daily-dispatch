Celebrations erupted after all five alleged killers of former Bhisho official Nosipho Sidabuka-Jombile, popular known as Ma-J, were denied bail by the Qumbu magistrate's court on Thursday. The #JusticeForMaJ movement, led by Lawrance Mambila, couldn't contain their excitement as they celebrated after the bail bid failed. The members of the movement had been protesting outside the court opposing bail at every hearing. Sidabuka-Jombile's ex-husband, Phindile Jombile, 52, a Mthatha police warrant officer, his current wife Lindiwe Komanisi-Jombile, 39, his wife’s sister Sibongile Komanisi, 41, and two alleged hitmen — Danisile Bhutyumpha, 55, and Paul Edkins, 38 — face charges, including kidnapping, murder, conspiracy to murder, attempted murder and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. The 51-year-old woman’s lifeless body was found at Zandukwana forest near Mthatha on June 12 after she was kidnapped at Shawbury Junction near Tsitsa Bridge while driving with her son Abongile, 22, from their Mabaleni home to Qumbu town on June 11. Magistrate Vuyisani Dyomfana said he had found no exceptional circumstances that could permit the accused to be released on bail and their release would not be in the interest of justice. The case was postponed to October 30 for a high court trial date. ​
