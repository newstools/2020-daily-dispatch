Conference calls have replaced many traditional classes, as people around the world practise self-isolation and social distancing to halt the spread of Covid-19. Remote conferencing apps have become the go-to video platform for calls, online classes, and social-distancing parties. But while some try to avoid walking around half-naked or limit the sound of background noise during calls, others are out here finding a more creative way to bunk online class. In a viral video, one student named “Tyler” staged his “kidnapping” to get out of an online class. In the 23-second clip, a professor can be heard talking about “moving paragraphs around” when two masked and hooded figures are seen walking into the room. They grab the student and drag him out of the room. The professor stops for a moment with a confused look. “Did you guys just see Tyler get kidnapped?” he asks, as another student can be heard giggling in the background. “Do we need to call the police?” the professor adds. Watch the video below. In another video, also doing the rounds on social media, a student pretends to fight back against his kidnappers in a struggle that lasts a few seconds before the group successfully carries him out of frame. A similar video was shared on Instagram, showing two figures throw a bag over a student's head and carry her away from a Zoom call. “Oh my god,” the teacher says. “What did I just witness?”
