Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  unveiled on Wednesday what he said was a far-reaching plan to help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic while ensuring efforts to fight the outbreak did not falter. Trudeau, who has consistently vowed to do more to combat climate change, is paring down talk of a green revolution to slash reliance on export of fossil fuels as Canada faces a resurgence in coronavirus cases. “The three prongs of what we are doing are fighting Covid-19, supporting Canadians, and a resilient recovery,” said a government source. The so-called Speech from the Throne outlining government plans was a confidence measure and given that Trudeau’s Liberals only have a minority in the House of Commons, they  need the support of opposition legislators to avoid being toppled and plunging the country into an election. The left-leaning New Democrats have made it clear they are likely to vote in favour. Trudeau’s popularity initially soared over his handling of the pandemic, but polls suggest he and the Liberals were damaged by a scandal over his close ties to a charity chosen to run a student grant programme. Parliament is usually packed for the occasion but Covid-19 meant few legislators were   present when Governor-General Julie Payette — the representative of Queen Elizabeth, Canada’s head of state —  delivered the speech. Later on Wednesday, Trudeau  made a national address  on the urgency of fighting Covid-19, a spokesperson said. The throne speech  contained policy proposals such as childcare and an expanded employment insurance programme rather than specific spending commitments, some of which will be disclosed in a fiscal update later in the year. But Trudeau  stressed the need for environmental policies such as retrofitting buildings, boosting the use of electric vehicles and biofuels. — Reuters
