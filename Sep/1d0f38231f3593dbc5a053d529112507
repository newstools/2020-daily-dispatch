Children from Emzi Junior Secondary School in Komani will go to school with smiles after being kitted out with new school shoes on Thursday. Fifty pupils from the school were each given a pair of school shoes, thanks to Ayanda Ncinane, a former pupil at the school, who raised money through his own foundation, named the Ayanda Ncinane Foundation. Ncinane was deeply moved by the plight of children who go to school barefoot, while others were attending school with torn shoes. Ncinane said he attributes his achievements to the school as  “they laid a solid foundation on me”. “Growing up in my village was not an easy task, so I know how it feels to have nothing, especially a school uniform. I asked the principal and staff to identify needy learners. Beneficiaries are identified by the staff. I am ploughing back to my school,” he said. He lives by the motto that “it takes the entire village to raise a child”. A parent at the school, Nowinile Mkhenkce, whose child also received a new pair of shoes, said she was grateful for the donation. “It will make a change in my child's life and bring back his self-esteem.” DispatchLIVE
