A suspected East London armed robber was shot dead, while another was rushed to hospital with gunshot wounds during a dramatic shootout with law enforcement officers at a Kwa Thanda Bantu clothing store on Friday afternoon. A senior police official who is not authorised to speak to the media confirmed the incident saying the man was shot and died inside the shop at 12 noon. Police had cordoned off the area when DispatchLIVE arrived on the scene. There was drama when the body of the deceased fell to the ground while it was being carried to the forensics vehicle. A police officer said: “We responded while the shooting was happening and when we got here I saw people chasing one of the suspects and immediacy we closed the scene.” Details are still unclear at the moment, however, a reliable source from Red Alert Security said that “one suspect has passed away and the other taken to hospital with gunshot wounds.”
