Spring  is upon us and it has ushered much needed early rains in some parts of the country. One can only hope that these overnight downpours signal a great yield of rain to come throughout the year. In  previous years spring was welcomed in some areas through the practice of splashing each other with buckets of water, among other water games. While there are many ways we can celebrate the arrival of springtime, we can also agree that water should not be part of the games. SA  is a water-scarce country and it is everyone’s responsibility to preserve this precious liquid. With the lockdown restrictions further eased and the temperatures becoming warmer, water usage will probably increase,  but everyone is urged  to continue to use water sparingly, as encouraged by the department of water and sanitation. Seasons may change but our habits and efforts to preserve water should remain consistent. Luvo Dumse,  department of water &  sanitation
