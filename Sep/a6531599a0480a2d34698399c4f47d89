 It has been almost seven months  since the last ABC Motsepe League and other amateur league games took place, due to the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. The SA Soccer Association Eastern Cape on Thursday confirmed the proposed date for the resumption of the league. Fixtures will resume on October 1 and national play-offs are set to be played between October 15-20 in Gauteng. Safa met regional representatives to ensure  the message was communicated down to  local football associations to ensure compliance. The amateur leagues will also resume  if they strictly follow the Covid-19 regulations as prescribed by the government. Eastern Cape Safa  secretary Isaac Klaas questioned the  the state of readiness of  participating clubs in the province. ‘‘All the teams have to be ready, because the league has to be played to the finish in order for us to see who advances to the national play-offs,’’ he said. Klaas also questioned whether the playing format of these upcoming  final games would be similar to those in the premier division and national first division, where all the teams were inducted into a bio-bubble until the final game of the season. ‘‘So far the league will be played as per the previous set-up, before the league took a pause of seven months,’’ Klaas said. With only nine  games still to be played, Bizana Pondo Chiefs  tops the overall log standings with 47 points, just ahead  of second-placed  rivals Spear of the Nation who are   on 46 points. The ABC Motsepe League fixtures will resume on October 1 and  national play-offs will be played between October 15-20   in Gauteng. DispatchLIVE
