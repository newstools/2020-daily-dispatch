The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has called on the government to extend the driver’s licence renewal interval from five to 10 years. Outa’s Dominique Msibi said they believed that both the state and citizens would benefit from a formal extension. “This should save the SA consumer and government time and money, as well as improve the administration and manageability of the renewal process by the state,” she said. Msibi said they wrote to transport minister Fikile Mbalula requesting: She said the state’s inability to address the backlog of licence renewals was “spilling into a crisis of administrative challenges that has the potential for citizens to be deemed as  acting outside the law”. “The extension of the grace period for expired driver’s licence is becoming the norm. We believe there will be no adverse impact on the lives of South Africans in the case of extending driving licence renewal to 10 years,” she said. Meanwhile, the Automobile Association (AA) called for the implementation of a moratorium on fining motorists without renewed driving licences  “as a matter of urgency”. TimesLIVE
