The Eastern Cape department of public works & infrastructure has invested R20m towards its Covid-19 youth programme. Of the R20m set aside for the programme over six months, the lion's share,  R15m, will go towards paying the stipends of the 1,000 participants. A total of R3m will be used to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for the participants; R1.5m will be used to buy machinery and equipment and R500,000 will go towards training. The programme started in September and will end in February 2021 as the provincial government continues to ensure the Covid-19 curve is flattened. The participants are divided into occupational health and safety officer representatives; monitors and cleaners will play a crucial role in ensuring all government buildings are Covid-19 compliant and surfaces are sanitised and fumigated, among other responsibilities. DPWI provincial spokesperson Vuyokazi Mbanjwa said they had partnered with non-profit organisation, Scientology Volunteer Ministers, at no cost to taxpayers. Through the agreement, the NPO will offer basic fogging, disinfecting and decontamination skills to the participants; spearhead peer education, community mobilisation and public awareness on Covid-19; and teach the participants hygiene education. “The services offered by the Scientology Volunteers Ministers will be provided at no cost to the department and will be funded through donations. “Their assistance is given unconditionally in solidarity with the people of Eastern Cape and SA, in line with the directions provided by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Furthermore, an amount of R500,000 will be been set aside for the training of Covid-19 youth brigades programme on basic soft and technical skill,” she said.
