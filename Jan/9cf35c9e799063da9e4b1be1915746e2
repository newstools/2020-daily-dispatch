Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer will clash in Cape Town for the benefit of children next week  — but before that there will be a doubles match like no other when Rafa and Trevor Noah take on The Fed Express and Bill Gates. Federer will play Nadal on February 7 at 8pm at the Cape Town Stadium. Tickets, which went on sale in early September, sold out in minutes as the two icons attempt to set a world record for most attendees at a tennis match. The stadium has a capacity of more than 50,000 spectators. Noah sent a friendly warning to his opponents this week, reminding them that local fans will probably be on his side. “Hey@RogerFederer, you &@billgates want to play doubles against me & @RafaelNadal!? Okay. We accept your challenge, but be prepared for the crowd in SA to be on our side! See you Feb 7 in Cape Town! Masihambe!," he tweeted. “This Match in Africa is a dream comes true,” said Federer. “I will play in my mother’s home country against my toughest rival and friend Rafa Nadal. We share not only the love for tennis but also for the good cause of giving children a better start in education and in life. I feel privileged to have other leading philanthropists on board to entertain millions of people in the stadium and on TV. It will be a once‐in-lifetime moment for my family and me.” Nadal said: “Roger and I have shared so many magical moments on and off the court. Travelling with him to Cape Town and playing for the benefit of children is something I am very excited about. It will be my first time in the region with Roger as a tour guide — that will be fun.”
