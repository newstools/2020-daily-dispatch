The body of a 10-year-old boy, who got into difficulty at an unprotected beach on KwaZulu-Natal's Dolphin Coast, was recovered on Thursday morning. IPSS Medical Rescue's Paul Herbst said efforts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful. He said the boy got into difficulty in the water just north of the Salt Rock tidal pool and was last seen at 11am. He said members of police search and rescue (SAR), IPSS SAR and KwaDukuza lifeguards conducted a search using a water craft and swimmers. In a separate incident, a 10-year-old girl drowned at the Westville municipal swimming pool on Wednesday. Police divers from Durban police search and rescue pulled the girl out from the shallow end of the pool after she was found non-responsive in the water. Resuscitation efforts by paramedics failed and the girl was declared dead on the scene by Rescue Care paramedics. An inquest docket was opened.
