I don’t understand you. ” — 2013 Passion “I follow my passion, things that I love to do, like writing and storytelling, I enjoy that. I don’t find myself having to remind myself to work hard and push myself to stay on top of things because I just love doing it.” — 2013 Winning games “I’ll do whatever it takes to win games, whether it’s sitting on a bench waving a towel, handing a cup of water to a teammate, or hitting the game-winning shot.” — 2014. Beauty in struggle “As I sit here now, when I take off my shoe and I look down at my scar, I see beauty in it. I see all the hard work, all the sacrifices. I see the journey it took to get back to this point of being healthy. And I see beauty in that struggle. That’s what makes it beautiful.”- 2014 The next generation “I feel like it’s part of my responsibility to give back to the next generation, try to share and teach some of the things I have learned from some of the great players, great mentors, greats coaches  I’ve had.” — 2018 Working hard “You always want to outwork your potential. As hard as you believe you can work, you can work harder than that."- 2019
