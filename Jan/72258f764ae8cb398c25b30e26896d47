Border Alliance taxi association boss Siyabonga Tungu, 27, was shot dead at the parking lot of his Own Haven flat on Wednesday night where he was in hiding. The killing comes two months after Tungu miraculously escaped a drive-by shooting by  an unidentified  man on the R72 near Kidd's Beach which left his Quantum minibus taxi riddled with 15 bullet holes. The 9pm killing shocked hundreds of tenants of the low-cost block of flats. At the scene, more than 400 horrified tenants, mostly in their night gowns, gathered around the parking lot and stared silently at the lifeless body of Tungu. Police officers, including East London police station commander Brigadier Mxolisi Mqontyana, worked the scene for evidence. DispatchLIVE can reveal that tenants  on Thursday stormed the Belgravia Crescent offices of Own Haven over safety concerns. At the centre of the riot is an alleged decision by Own Haven to remove remote gates for boom gates with unarmed guards, said a source. Tungu's partner and stepdaughter were inconsolable at the scene. His partner, who asked not to be named, said Tunzu was killed for being “vocally truthful.” Witnesses told the Dispatch how two men armed with assault rifles, pumped six gunshots to Tungu's head at close range before speeding off in a Suzuki Swift car. The guards dove for cover as gunshots rang out in the bustling flats, the Dispatch was told. More details in tomorrow’s print edition of the Daily Dispatch. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
