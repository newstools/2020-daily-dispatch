Australia's consumer agency, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has examined hotel booking website Trivago and found that it is misleading in that it doesn't always give the lowest prices and what is shown is often misleading. There are a number of websites comparing hotel prices as well as a great range of other services and products, although most of them state in small writing that they don't cover all available options. These sites are valuable for the lazy traveller and a useful start for the more experienced one. They list and map a number of accommodation options, but they should only be a starting guide. I always do a general look and then go direct to the hotel's own website and book directly — usually for a better price. The hotels appreciate the direct booking as they are getting all of the money. A Google map check will show the general area as there can be lovely hotels in odd locations, distant from transport and tourist locations, and it is best to do the extra work and check things. Basically the message is one for the modern world — don't trust everything you see on the internet and don't be lazy when spending large amounts of money. — Dennis Fitzgerald, via e-mail
