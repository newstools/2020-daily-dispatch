Five teenagers were killed and several other passengers hurt in a horrific accident on the R61  between Ngcobo and Cofimvaba in the early hours of Monday. Eastern Cape transport department spokesperson Unathi Binqose said the accident took place near Bayele village at about 5am. The victims were travelling in a Toyota Quantum minibus which overturned. The five who died were aged between 15 and 19. “It is alleged that the  driver lost control of the vehicle and it overturned,” said Binqose. “The taxi was travelling from Cape Town to Qumbu and KwaBhaca [formerly Mount Frere]. Its passengers were mostly teenagers believed to have been travelling home after spending the holiday period in Cape Town.” The injured were rushed to the All Saints Hospital in Ngcobo. Binqose was unable to say how many teens were being treated for injuries, only that some were in a serious condition while others had sustained minor injuries. A case of culpable homicide has been opened for further investigation by police. Eastern Cape education MEC Fundile Gade sent his condolences to the families of the deceased. “One would hope that public transport drivers would heed the calls made by the transport minister, Fikile Mbalula, and MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe to be more careful on the roads now that our children are coming back and the schools get ready to reopen,” Gade said. Binqose appealed to motorists to exercise greater caution, especially in inclement weather. “The volume of traffic will increase, possibly until February when tertiary students begin studies. Even more caution is needed as roads have become wet due to rains and there were also reports  of rocks falling on roads,” he added. sikhon@dispatch.co.za
