In a viral petition, more than a million people have called on the NBA to add to its logo an image of  multi-award-winning basketball star Kobe Bryant. The petition was started by Nick M on Change.org on Monday morning. Pleading with Bryant's supporters to back him, Nick said: “With the untimely passing of the great Kobe Bryant, please sign this petition in an attempt to immortalise him forever as the new NBA logo.” Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others died on Sunday when the helicopter they were in crashed into a remote field in Las Virgenes, the Californian city of Calabasas confirmed on Sunday. The current logo, according to BBC, bears the silhouette of 81-year-old former LA Lakers player Jerry West.
