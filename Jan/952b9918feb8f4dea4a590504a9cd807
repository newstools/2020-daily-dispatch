East London jobseekers will be able to benefit from a new initiative from Uber through which they can access free rides to job interviews. The rideshare service has partnered with job finder agency Trusted Interns to offer R10,000 worth of rides to those seeking work. Job seekers in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth can also benefit from the  #GiveTheYouthAchance campaign. A backabuddy fundraising campaign has also been launched by Trusted Interns, and Uber has pledged to match another R10,000 for whatever money is raised on the platform. “We believe that talent is normally distributed in our world, but opportunity is not. A major contributor to the youth unemployment problem in South Africa is the lack of access that job seekers have to employment opportunities,” Trusted Interns said. “We asked our community if they'd ever missed an interview because of transport costs, 77% of them said yes.” Trusted Interns also asked how many people needed transport to interviews, and more than 1,500 said they would. “We’ve partnered with Uber to solve this problem, and to give these candidates access to more employment opportunities. They have kicked off the donations with R10 000. You can #GiveTheYouthAChance by giving them access. Donations from the public will be matched by Uber, allowing us to give more people more access.” Both those wanting to donate funds to paying for Uber rides and job seekers can visit www.trusedinterns.co.za to learn more.
