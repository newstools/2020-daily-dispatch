The national pass rate increased  to 81.3% from 78.2% in 2018. This was announced by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Tuesday afternoon. A total of 616,754 full time pupils and 170,963 part time pupils wrote the final year exams, with all 75 national districts achieving more than a 60% pass rate. Motshekga said the Nelson Mandela Metro was the leading district in the Eastern Cape. Motshekga said: “None of the 75 districts performed below 60% for the first time. Ten of our districts performed over 80%.” She said the education department had made great strides towards achieving their #2030NationalDevelopmentPlan goals. “We are announcing the results with only 10 years remaining before 2030. The national development plan says SA should have access to quality education to international assessment standards. Our system has been on a steady rise.” The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) matric class of 2019 achieved a pass rate of 98.82%  — slightly down from the 98.92% registered in 2018.
