The Makana municipal council must be dissolved and a new administrator appointed until a new council is elected, the  High Court in Makhanda ordered on Tuesday. In a groundbreaking judgment of  more than 100 pages, Judge Igna Stretch ruled the Makana Municipality was contravening the constitution by failing to sustainably provide services to the community or to structure and manage its administration, budget and planning process. It had also failed to give priority to  basic needs of the community or to promote its social and economic development, she said. She ordered the provincial executive to immediately implement a recovery plan aimed at securing the Makana Municipalityâ€™s ability to meet its obligations.
