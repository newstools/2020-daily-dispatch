The National Union of Metal Workers of SA (Numsa) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) will picket at Eskomâ€™s Megawatt Park in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The protest is to voice their opposition to the privatisation and unbundling of the troubled power utility by the government. They have also called for the removal of public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan. The EFF has called for Gordhan to be fired, threatening to disrupt the state of the nation address (Sona) if he is not. Gordhan's ability to resolve the Eskom and energy crisis has been brought into sharp focus after ongoing power cuts and general instability at the power utility. The resignation of Eskom's board chairperson, Jabu Mabuza, appears to have been the final nail on the coffin, prompting  various stakeholders to demand the government finds a permanent solution to the country's energy crisis.
