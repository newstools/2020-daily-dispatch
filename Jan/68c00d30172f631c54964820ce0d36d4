I was of the view that "toeing the line" means following the majority decision or consensus. Is it not talking along the same lines with your comrades or with the leadership of your organisation or business? Finance minister Tito Mboweni in the past few days just highlighted some really critical issues facing the economy of our beloved country. In the opposite corner hyenas have their teeth sharpened to tear apart visionaries like him. He was told to toe the line. This has happened to many patriotic comrades who are trying to undo corruption and expose state capturers. At Nasrec in December 2017 the ANC's 54th national elective conference elected a new leadership and Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president of the party. How many times has secretary-general Ace Magashule stepped out of line and undermined Cyril without any provocation? He has undermined the collective by constantly referring to Jacob Zuma as his president. He even, without being mandated to say it, declared that Cyril will be in charge for one term. Did he ever toe the line? I guess he must just go retire on his Estina farm. — Z Tikana, via e-mail
