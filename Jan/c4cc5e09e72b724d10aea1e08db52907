Graduating from initiation school is a special event, but even more so when you come back to a new home and several prominent government officials are on hand to meet you. Masilakhe Maruqula, 19, has become something of a celebrity in Xazini village, Willowvale since three MECs and businessman Chippa United FC chairperson Chippa Mpengesi came together to build a new home for him and his grandparents. The family lived in a ramshackle rondavel before the provincial government stepped in. On Friday, Maruqula laid his eyes on his new home for the first time. '''This is really amazing. I am overwhelmed by all this. It is unbelievable that we have such a beautiful, decent house.  Three weeks ago we were living in a dilapidated rondavel. Now we have a new house, beds and a TV set for the first time in our lives,''  Masilakhe said. On Thursday the new home was handed over to his grandparents, Nondungunyana and Nonelisi Maruqula, by human settlements MEC Nonkqubela Pieters and education MEC Fundile Gade. Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba also ensured that Maruqula was able to attend initiation school after learning that his grandparents could not afford the ceremony. Gomba roped in Pieters and Mpengesi to build the family a decent house. Gade also organised for the young graduate to attend King Hintsa TVET College. On Friday, Gomba said her son had been a teetotaller when he went to initiation school, but when he returned he drank, smoked and started doing drugs. He lost his life as a result. ''I am adopting Masilakhe and hope that he will not do what my son did. We hope Masilakhe will maintain his good discipline and focus on the bright life that lies ahead,'' said Gomba. ''I will never forget that God has sent Good Samaritans to assist us. A big thank you to MEC Gomba and the  other MECs, to Mr Mpengesi and all those who have restored our family's dignity. I will never forget where I come from and the good things people did for me and my family,” Maruqula said.
