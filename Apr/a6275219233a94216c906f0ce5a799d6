Rhodes University vice Chancellor, Dr Sizwe Mabizela, has pledged 33% of his salary for three months to the COVID-19 relief fund. Describing the disease as the “greatest health challenge in living memory”, Mabizela said his pledge was in direct response to president Cyril Ramaphosa's call to contribute to assist the government to cushion the impact of the pandemic in the country. According to the university’s most recent available annual report, Mabizela earns a basic salary of about R2.4 million a year. This means that he will donate about R66 000 a month to the cause, or a total of R198 000 over three months. He said he was committed to supporting the courageous, dedicated and selfless frontline health workers through the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the money he donated would go towards the Solidarity Fund set up for this purpose. “The heroism, bravery and selfless service of frontline health workers who expose their lives and those of their loved ones to great risk to save others must be applauded. They place their vocation and care for others ahead of their personal health risks. They deserve to be protected from such exposure to risk.” Ramaphosa last week announced that he and his executive as well as all provincial premiers would take a 33% pay cut for the next three months. The money saved – said to total over R13m – will go towards the Covid-19 Solidarity Fund. The fund has already raised more than R2bn.
