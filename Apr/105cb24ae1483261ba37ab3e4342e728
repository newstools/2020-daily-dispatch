President Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president, as well as their ministers and deputy ministers, will take a one-third cut in their salaries for the next three months. This portion of their salaries will be donated to the Solidarity Fund, the president announced on Thursday night. “The premiers of our provinces have also joined in and will take a one-third pay cut and donate that the Solidarity Fund,” the president said. Ramaphosa had minutes earlier in his address announced that the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Coviod-19 would be extended by an additional two weeks.
