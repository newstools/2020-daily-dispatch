Reliable sources told DispatchLIVE  that the man was traveling towards Cala when he came across police who were manning the roadblock. According to the sources, the police tried to stop the vehicle he was driving but he allegedly sped off. “He is facing charges of drunken driving and failure to stop at a roadblock,” said one source. The 39-year-old politician was driving a Golf GTI. “There was liquor in his car. He failed to produce a driver's license at the roadblock at Gushingane and sped off.
