I don’t understand why we should pay fees in full during lockdown ("Parents will still have to pay private school fees", Daily Dispatch, April 6). It is not always the case  that there is teaching  happening online. Certain class packs  are sent out and are not mandatory or  are very similar to what one can find online. Why then must  parents pay full school fees for this? Besides that, we as parents take our children  through the subject matter and not  their teachers. I don’t think the whole idea  is fair for us since we are also losing income due  to the lockdown.  Why are  we  expected to pay for services not rendered?. Nobody has asked that fundamental question. If online classes were always available, or  a full day’s curriculum online, I would understand. As a gesture of good faith I have made full payments in advance as I always do but I feel robbed.  I am also taking a salary cut, so who can we take it up with? -Frustrated parent, via e-mail
