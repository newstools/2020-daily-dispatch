Minister of COGTA Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and minister of trade and industry Ebrahim Patel will on Saturday provide a detailed briefing on the classification of industries as part of the risk-adjusted strategy on the reopening the economy as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The briefing serves as the official launch of the risk-adjusted strategy for public comment and consultation. Finance minister Tito Mboweni said on Friday that businesses hoping to open and thrive post the coronavirus lockdown should consider amending their labour market policies to favour unemployed South Africans. Spelling out how government's R500bn relief fund aimed at helping vulnerable South Africans, businesses and the economy would be used, he said things had changed over the last two decades and the country's unemployed workers were being left behind.
