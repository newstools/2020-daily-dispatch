The watchdog also recorded six deaths as a result of police action, two each in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape. Ipid recorded 12 cases of discharge of an official firearm, one of rape by a police official, 14 of assault and three cases of corruption. Of the total complaints received, 14 were recorded in Gauteng, and Free State and KwaZulu-Natal recorded five cases each.
