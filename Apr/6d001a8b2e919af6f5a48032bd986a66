President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday night outlined a five-stage lockdown plan that will be implemented from May 1. He said the plan was a risk-adjusted strategy based on a “deliberate and cautious approach to easing of lockdown restrictions”. Ramaphosa said that because much about the coronavirus is unknown, action must be incremental. SA is now in a level 5 lockdown, which requires drastic measures to save lives. Level 4 allows some activity to resume while levels 3 and 2 ease restrictions and promote social distancing. Level 1 means that most activities can return to normal. — Borders remain closed to international travel, except for repatriation of SA citizens and foreigners to their countries — There will be no travel between provinces, except for transport of goods and exceptional circumstances such as funerals — Public transport will continue but within limits and certain hygiene guidelines — People can exercise, but under strict public health provisions — Sale of cigarettes will be allowed — Elderly and those with underlying conditions must stay home —Range of goods that can be sold will be extended — Work from home if you can — People encouraged to stay home — Bars, clubs, theatres remain closed Ramaphosa said ministers would elaborate on details about the lockdown levels soon.
