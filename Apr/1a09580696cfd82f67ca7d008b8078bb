A wholesale building in Durban's central business district was swarming with health officials dressed in protective gear on Wednesday after the department of economic development received a complaint that people with Covid-19 symptoms were trading there. Health workers and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) screened workers at the Xinhua Distribution Centre, a wholesale and retail outlet with stores run by Chinese nationals, after they sealed off entry into and out of the building and cordoned off the road. "In the complaint received, workers alleged that they were subjected to unhygienic conditions. They complained that they were exposed to risks associated with coronavirus," said department spokesperson Ndabe Sibiya. "It is with this reason that the MEC handed over this complaint to health." Sibiya did not go into details about the full nature of the complaint, but said the relevant departments would do so. “A decision was made that before a raid could be conducted, safety measures should be put in place and that people who live in the building be subjected to intensive screening,” said the department of economic development in their initial statement. "From where we are seated, we can confirm that the health department is here screening people and that when the time is right, more information will be given by the relevant authorities," said Sibiya. He said the department would provide further information after the screening was completed. The KZN department of health did not respond to queries.
