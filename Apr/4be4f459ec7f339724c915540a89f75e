Police in Peddie are hot on the heels of three suspects who pretended to be livestock buyers and allegedly murdered two women on Saturday. The women, aged 49 and 73 were in their home in Celetyuwa administration area, provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana confirmed. The incident is alleged to have happened at 6pm. “The neighbour, who assisted the deceased with her livestock, allegedly found three unknown males inside the house talking to the deceased about sheep. He then left and went home leaving the deceased with the unknown males. “The following day, in the morning, he came back to open the kraal to take the livestock to the veld. Upon his return he went and knocked at the house as he hadn't see the deceased that morning,” Kinana said. "All the doors were still locked and when he tried to phoned them, their cellphones rang inside," he said. “He then phoned the woman’s son who instructed him to kick the down door and he found the deceased with stab wounds in their upper bodies." Kinana said investigation continues and no arrests were made yet. “Police appeal to anyone who might be able to assist with any information that could lead to the arrest of the three suspects to contact Brigadier Dudu Ngculu on 082 301 7762 or any nearest police station. Information can also be shared on SAPS Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Callers may remain anonymous if they wish to and all information will be treated with the strict confidence,” he said.
