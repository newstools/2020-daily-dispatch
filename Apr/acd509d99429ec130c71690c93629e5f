The 21-day national Covid-19 lockdown is proving to be something of a challenge for families stuck indoors with small children. To try to bring them some much-needed relief, Ford has launched its Family Fun Hub: an online portal packed with downloadable content that has been designed to keep young ones amused while they #StayHome. Some of the highlights include a colouring book, maze, connect the dots and spot the difference. All items can be downloaded in PDF format and printed out at leisure - simply add coloured pencils, highlighters, koki pens - or wax crayons - and you're good to go. Ford says it will be updating the portal regularly with an ever-expanding array of boredom-busting content. To get started simply click on over to the Family Fun Hub. In the public interest, none of our coronavirus news coverage will be placed behind our paywall and will be available free for all to read.
