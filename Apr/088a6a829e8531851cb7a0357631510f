The highest numbers of infections of Covid-19 in South Africa are for people in the age groups 21 to 60, according to figures released on Monday by health minister Zweli Mkhize. The youngest and oldest members of the population seem to have avoided the mass impact of the coronavirus pandemic thus far. South Africa reported 3,300 infections in total by Monday, with 1,055 recoveries and 58 deaths, including 4 new reported deaths since Sunday’s report, according to Mkhize. The minister presented an analysis of the infection across all population age groups based on the total  number of infections as at Sunday, April 19. According to the analysis, of the 3,158 infections reported then, the highest number, 768 people or 24.3% of the total infections, occurred in the 31 to 40 years age group. The 21 to 30 years age group recorded 628 or 19.9% of the total infections, the 41 to 50 years age group recorded 594 or 18.8% of the population, and the 51 to 60 years age group recorded 505 or 15,9% of the population. Youths under 20 made up only 7.3% of all infections, while those older than 61 years constituted 14.2%. On average women constituted more infections than men, making up 1,727 infections across all ages, compared to the 1,415 men who have been infected thus far. The next important indicator of the impact of the virus will be the age spread of those who have died and their comorbidities. — DispatchLIVE  In the public interest, most of our coronavirus news isn’t behind our paywall, and is free to read.
