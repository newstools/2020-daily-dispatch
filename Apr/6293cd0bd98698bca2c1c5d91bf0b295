President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday night addressed the nation and announced that the national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 would be extended by an additional two weeks. “Since I announced the lockdown two weeks ago, the global coronavirus pandemic has worsened. We have over 1.5m confirmed cases worldwide. Over 90,000 people across the world have died of this disease,” he said. “This evening I stand before you to ask you to endure even longer. I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis,” Ramaphosa said. The president ended off his address by saying: “Much is being asked of you, far more than should ever be asked. But we know that this is a matter of survival, and we dare not fail. We shall recover. We shall overcome. May God bless South Africa and protect her people.” This is a developing story. In the public interest, none of our coronavirus news coverage will be behind our paywall.
