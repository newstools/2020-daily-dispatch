Residents of Nigeria's northern metropolis and Islamic centre of Kano were allowed out Friday to buy food on the first day of Ramadan, despite a coronavirus lockdown. Authorities imposed a lockdown on in this city of about million on April 16. The move sparked controversy over the closing of mosques and the banning of collective prayers. But the local government decided to loosen the lockdown from 6am on Friday to midnight to allow inhabitants to purchase food ahead of a month-long fast — although most mosques remained closed. “I never imagined Kano could suspend Friday prayers for two weeks at a stretch,” said Usman Sani as he sheltered under a tree outside his house in the city's Hotoro district. Last week saw some believers in the city, governed by Sharia law, defy the lockdown to head for mosques which had not suspended Friday prayers. Fifteen imams have since been arrested, police spokesperson Haruna Abdullahi said. Some towns in neighbouring Niger state saw rioting and hundreds of arrests after mass prayer gatherings were banned in the run-up to Ramadan. Kano state governor Abdullahi Ganduje meanwhile rejected media reports of large scale burials being undertaken in the city, referring to “normal” deaths rather than fatalities from coronavirus. To date, the virus has officially left one person dead and 75 sick in Kano state. The nationwide tally to Friday was 31 dead for around 1,000 cases although there has been growing criticism of low levels of testing in a nation of some 200 million.
