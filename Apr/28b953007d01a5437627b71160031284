 For the past six years as a young person, I have been admiring the charismatic  EFF leader and commander-in-chief Julius Malema. His stance on social struggles was an epitome for me until on Monday, when he delivered his  Freedom Day speech. He left me  very disappointed by his views concerning IMF loans and the reopening of economic sectors. Malema  is against the borrowing of money from multilateral institutions such as the IMF. He is also   against the reopening of economic sectors. Conversely his  organisation is advocating for a permanent grant  for the unemployed. This is confusing for me because I don’t understand where will the grant money come from if the economy  and businesses remain closed. Will these grants they are calling for be sustainable? This stance  is a clear sign of political immaturity. — Mvuzo Kepe, via e-mail
