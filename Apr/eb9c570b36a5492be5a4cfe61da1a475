The Eastern Cape social development department is to probe allegations that some ANC officials and leaders are prioritising members of the ruling party for food parcels meant for lockdown relief. On Monday afternoon, department spokesperson Gcobani Maswana told DispatchLIVE that he was aware of the allegations. However, Maswana said beneficiaries were subjected to strict verification processes and this was made the chances of corrupting the system slim. “Nevertheless, we are encouraging people who want to report corrupt activities linked to the distribution of food parcels to come forward so that their complaints can be investigated,” he added. In East London, leaders and officials from areas like Braelyn and Duncan Village were among those accused of overlooking needy people who are not ANC members. The allegations have irked social media users, who accused “greedy officials of abusing their power”. “I totally see no reason we give leadership [positions] to people who are unable to do research and deliver to communities ... this is enough. It is time people take up petition against people who can't act accordingly and have stakeholders of different parties to make success of projects. This is painful,” wrote one social media user on Facebook after a heated debate over the food parcels allegations ensued. DispatchLIVE had not yet received comment from the ANC provincial leadership at the time of publication. In the public interest, none of our coronavirus news coverage will be behind our paywall.
