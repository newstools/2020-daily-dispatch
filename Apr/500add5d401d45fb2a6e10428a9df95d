The Daily Dispatch and Saturday Dispatch are still being published and distributed from Monday to Saturday, even during SA's coronavirus lockdown. However, these highly unusual circumstances have led to some interruptions – but fear not, subscribers who missed their favourite read in print can also get it online. The e-edition is an exact digital replica of the print edition of the Daily Dispatch or Saturday Dispatch delivered via a service called PressReader. You can page through the newspaper online, via your internet browser or by using our e-edition app. The e-edition is available for subscribers only. View our subscription offers here.
