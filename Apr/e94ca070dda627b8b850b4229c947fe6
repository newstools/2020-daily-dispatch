Mnquma municipality in Butterworth on Sunday said it had received with “great alarm and shock” a video clip apparently exposing bags of mealie meal infested with maggots. Reports suggest this bag may have been part of food parcels distributed to communities as part of the government food security programme amid the national Covid-19 coronavirus lockdown. Mnquma spokesperson Loyiso Mpalantshane said on Sunday his mayor, Sithembiso Ncetezo, has since extended his apology to all the affected communities. Mpalantshane said Ncetezo assured the people of Mnquma that the municipality had alerted Sassa and the department of social development, who in turn have committed to ensuring the situation will be resolved. “The municipality was not involved in the procurement of these products, but was merely co-ordinating the food distribution process to ensure fair and just allocation to deserving families. “We call on all affected communities to immediately stop consumption or use of the spoiled products and report similar incidences to the municipality or their nearest Sassa or social development offices,”  Mpalantshane said.
