Questions have been asked as to how the Eastern Cape government used a lodge owned by the daughter of transport MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe as a quarantine site for 14 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in Cacadu. Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba said she had had not been aware that Mioca Lodge in Cala had been used as a quarantine site. The lodge is owned by Tikana-Gxothiwe's daughter, Kwakhanya Tikana. After DispatchLIVE enquired as to whther there was no conflict of interest or nepotism in handpicking a company owned by the daughter of an MEC, the 14 were moved to Glen Grey Hospital on Friday. They had been at the facility since Wednesday. There were 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Chris Hani district by Friday afternoon Gomba told journalists that Emalahleni mayor Ntombizanele Koni had raised concerns that the 14 would possibly infect more people with the novel virus. “The next I know is that people had already been picked up,” she said. Tikana said everything had been done above board but would not say how much she had been paid. “That you will have to check with the state. I am running a business and the contract I have with my client is between me and the client. Fortunately since the state can freely declare such information as required by law, they are better positioned to answer this one,” she said. Premier Oscar Mabuyane spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha had not commented at the time of writing. Read more on DispatchLIVE or in the Daily Dispatch tomorrow.
