ANC provincial chair and Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane on Tuesday distanced the ruling party from claims of food parcel corruption and vowed to “stop the rot” if anyone is found guilty. On Monday, ANC leaders and officials were accused of food parcel corruption. The Eastern Cape department of social development said it was set to investigate the claims. Mabuyane told DispatchLIVE: “We note the allegations made about partisan considerations in the distribution of food parcels. The investigation by the department of social development is welcomed.” He added: “We want to inform the people of the province that food parcels are given to individuals and families that are in distress with no means to buy their own food. This is a cushion against hardship that government is providing to the vulnerable people of our country.” Mabuyane made it clear that there was no policy of food parcels being distributed according to political affiliations. The ANC, he said, did not subscribe to that view and had no intention “to behave in such an unconstitutional manner”. “Food parcels, and any other social relief support, are given to vulnerable people that face hardships like poverty, unemployment. These challenges know no partisan affiliation,” he said. “If the probe by social development reveals any wrongdoing by any individual, we will act against those individuals. We cannot allow anyone to do things contained in these allegations. If these allegations are true, we will stop this rot immediately and hold those who would be found guilty to account. “We must make sure that people who are in need of government support always get it according to their needs and not any other considerations.” ​ In the public interest, none of our coronavirus news coverage will be behind our paywall.
