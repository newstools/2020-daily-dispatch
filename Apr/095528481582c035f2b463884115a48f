Little Louise de Klerk from Cradock celebrated her 4th birthday today, Monday 6 April. While family and friends all showered her with phone calls and Facetime chats, she was a bit sad at not being able to have a proper birthday party with friends. Luckily a group of hardworking men in the refuse removal team from Inxuba Yethemba municipality, on duty today,  took the time to serenade little Louise. When DispatchLIVE asked Louise’s father, Ricky, whether the friendly team would be getting some cake soon, he laughed. “Oh, they already got their share today! We wouldn’t have it any other way!” In the public interest, none of our coronavirus news coverage will be behind our paywall. It is available free for all to read.
